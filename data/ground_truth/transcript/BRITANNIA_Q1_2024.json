        "revenue_performance": "Revenue grew 9% YoY, matching the transaction growth of 9%, but **volume growth was flattish (zero)**. This was due to price increases/rationalizations.",
        "profitability": "Operating Profit grew 37% YoY, with a strong margin of 15.6%. Profitability was helped by significant deflation in **palm oil (21%)** and packaging materials (laminates, corrugated boxes).",
