On behalf of the management of Dabur India Limited, I\nwelcome you to the Earnings Conference Call pertaining to the results for Q2 FY '25. Present\nhere with me are Mr. Mohit Malhotra, Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ankush Jain, Chief Financial\nOfficer; Mr. Rehan Hasan, Head of Sales; Mrs. Gagan Ahluwalia, VP-Corporate Affairs; and\nMr. N. Krishnan, General Manager-Finance. We will start with an overview of the company's\nperformance by Mr. Mohit Malhotra, and this will be followed by a Q&A session.\nI'll now hand over to Mr. Mohit. Thank you.\nMohit Malhotra: Thank you, Isha. Good evening, ladies, and gentlemen. We welcome you to Dabur India\nLimited's conference call pertaining to results for the quarter ended 30th September 2024. This\nquarter, the sector faced challenges from heavy monsoons, floods, and high food inflation, which\nslowed down urban consumption, especially in the beverage category for us. However, rural\ncontinues to be resilient and has outpaced urban growth for last 3 quarters. We believe urban\nconsumption has bottomed out and should see an improvement going forward.\nAs new channels have been growing ahead of general trade, this has put some pressure on\nprofitability of our GT channel partners. We recognize the challenging times faced by our GT\nchannel partners who are integral to Dabur and have significantly contributed to building our\nesteemed business. As part of our commitment to good governance and in solidarity with them,\nwe have undertaken one-time strategic initiative to rationalize inventories and enhance their\nprofitability. As a result, our consolidated revenue declined by 5.5%. While this one-off\nproactive measure resulted in a temporary dip in sales, this was necessary step to enhance the\nprofitability of our GT distributors and ensure long-term health and hygiene of our business.\nOur business fundamentals remain strong with all underlining key consumer metrices of market\nshare, household penetration, secondary sales and compounded annual growth on a positive\ntrajectory. Our secondary sales during the quarter grew by 2.3% year-on-year with Home and\nPersonal Care growing at 6%, Health Care growing by 4%. In addition, we gained market share\nacross 95% of our portfolio.\nThe international business exhibited resilience and registered a strong growth of 13% in constant\ncurrency terms. Within the domestic business, Home and Personal Care secondary sales grew\nby around 6%. Hair Oils grew ahead of the category and gained 40 bps market share. We are\nmarket leaders in hair oils with representation in both coconut and perfumed hair oils. A key\nwhite space has been premium Ayurvedic hair oil segment that we have been calling out for a\nlong time.\nI'm happy to announce that Dabur has entered into an agreement to merge Sesa Care Private\nLimited, which has a consolidated turnover of INR133 crores. This proposed merger brings to\nDabur the premium Sesa brand with strong credentials around Ayurveda that will complement\nour existing portfolio and strengthen our presence in the INR14,000 crores hair oil category.\nGiven Dabur's extensive distribution network and category leadership, this transaction will bring\nin substantial revenue and cost synergies. Sesa brand will also enable us to premiumize our hair\nPage 2 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\noil portfolio as it is gross margin accretive. International businesses contribute to 19% of overall\nSesa’s sales with Sesa being number 1 Ayurvedic therapeutic hair oil in Bangladesh market.\nHome Care portfolio continued on a strong growth trajectory with 9% year-on-year secondary\nsales growth and market share gains of 220 bps in air fresheners and 510 bps in mosquito\nrepellent cream category. We continue to premiumize and expand our product range in Odonil\nwith gel pockets, diffusers, and premium air fresheners. We have extended Odomos brand into\nliquid vaporizer format, which is seeing an encouraging response from the market. We intend to\nscale up this during upcoming months.\nThis initiative will enable the Home Care portfolio to grow in double digits going forward in the\nfuture, taking up the portfolio from INR700 crores to around INR1,000 crores in 2 to 3 years'\ntimeframe. In oral care category, our flagship brand, Dabur Red recorded secondary sales of\naround 5%. We have a strong number 2 position in the category with 1 out of every 2 households\nusing Dabur Oral Care products.\nDabur Red toothpaste has a number 1 position in states like Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil\nNadu. I'm happy to inform you that Dabur Red has become India's first Ayurvedic toothpaste to\nget accreditation and recognition from Indian Dental Association, a consortium of allopathic\ndental practitioners. Going forward, we will ramp up our engagement with dentist community\nto cover around 1 lakh dentists.\nOur Health Care segment posted a secondary sales growth of 4%. To promote all-weather\nconsumption of Chyawanprash, we rolled out a special monsoon campaign during the quarter,\nwhich has resulted in secondary growth of 12.6% in Chyawanprash. The brand gained 20 bps\nmarket share to reach 61%. The Chyawanprash category penetration has improved by 10 lakh\nhouseholds from pre-COVID levels.\nTo drive premiumization, we recently launched the Khajurprash variant, which was very well\nreceived by the consumers. Digestives portfolio recorded a secondary growth of 6% year-on-\nyear, led by good growth in Hajmola and market share gains of 160 bps. Dabur Honey also grew\nahead of the category and gained market share of 60 bps. Health Juices and Shilajit recorded a\nyear-on-year growth of 20% each and Baby Care portfolio grew by 30%.\nIn Foods category, the business performed well with 20.6% growth in secondary sales. Badshah\ncontinued on a strong footing and grew by 15%, both primary and secondary terms, driven by\n15% volume growth. Food business, including Badshah, will cross INR500 crores this year, as\nalluded earlier. We intend to continue to grow Foods vertical aggressively going forward as well.\nDue to aggressive monsoons leading to floods and landslides in some parts of the country, the\nJuices and Nectar category declined in high single digits. Despite the slowdown, we grew ahead\nof the category and gained volume market shares of 240 bps. We have put in place a\nmultipronged strategy of ramping up our drinks portfolio, improving affordability through pack\nprice architecture, revenue growth management and drive premiumization in emerging channels\nand expanding the distribution footprint to put Juices and Nectars back on the growth trajectory.\nPage 3 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nComing to profitability, the consolidated gross margins expanded by 102 basis points. The\ncompany increased its investment in advertising and promotion and went up from 6.8% of net\nsales in quarter 2 to 7.4%. However, deleverage on account of decline in revenue impacted the\noperating profit, which declined by 16.4%.\nI am pleased to announce that our company's Dow Jones Sustainability Index score has reported\n170% improvement from 30 to 81 in last 2 years, reflecting our unwavering commitment to\nsustainability and responsible governance.\nI would like to once again reassure you that the underlying business fundamentals remain strong\nand overall health of the business continues to be robust. With rural growth continuing to be\nresilient, urban slowdown expected to have bottomed out and riding on the strategic initiatives,\nwe are confident of our performance in the upcoming quarters to be back on track. We remain\ndedicated to investing behind our brands, expanding our distribution reach, and building our\nback-end capabilities to continue to deliver superior value creation.\nWith this, I conclude my address and open the floor to Q&A. Thank you.\nAbneesh Roy from Nuvama\nAbneesh Roy: My first question is on toothpaste. So we have seen 3 results till now in that space. You have\ngrown by 5% and the market leader has grown in double digits with around 8% volume growth.\nAnd the number 3 player has also seen high single-digit growth. So one, how do you see your\ngrowth versus the other 2 players? Second, have you seen a sharp ramp-up in the competitive\nintensity in Q2 and do you see this as a structural development or that was a one-off given the\nmargin pressure which market leader saw?\nMohit Malhotra: Right. So Abneesh, overall, Oral Care category is growing quite well. We have grown ahead of\nthe category at around 5% value, and we've gained market shares also in Dabur Red. Besides\nDabur Red, even Meswak has performed very well in the quarter. Dabur Herbal toothpaste for\nus has also been doing very well. Lal Dant Manjan, which is our tooth powder brand, has also\ngrown by 7% in terms of secondary.\nSo all the vectors of oral care for us have done well in the market and market shares have gone\nwell. I can't comment so much on the competitor. But as far as we are there, I think Oral Care is\none of the very aggressive vectors, which we will keep pushing to drive our growth.\nOn Oral Care, I would want to mention one thing that we are really seeing huge tailwinds on our\nproduct portfolio and international business. Oral Care will be one of the second vectors of our\ngrowth besides Hair Care in the international business. We have completely saturated our\ninstalled capacity in markets like Egypt, MENA etc. on Oral Care, and we are augmenting\ncapacity there. So there is a real heavy tailwind towards herbal, natural and Ayurvedic products\nin oral care.\nIn many countries, in MENA and in Egypt, we have already become number 2 and number 3\nbrands placating large global competitors that we have there. As a matter of fact, in Egypt, we've\nbecome the number 2 brand in Oral Care, and we are putting up special installed capacities and\nPage 4 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nthe business is surging at the rate of around 70% to 80% on volume terms. Even in MENA, we\nare seeing a huge growth happening in Oral Care. As far as competitive intensity in India is\nconcerned, yes, from the competitor and the market leader, we've seen competitive intensity\ngone up, but we are matching up their prowess in trade and in visibility in the marketplace.\nAbneesh Roy: Understood. My second question is on the fruit juice and Campa Cola impact. You were the first\ncompany to really highlight the risk well before other companies. You said on the impact of\nCampa Cola in Q1. So I wanted to understand now Coca-Cola is also looking to cut prices from\nINR25 to INR20 in the 400 ml. So if you could talk about that, how does that impact your price\narchitecture?\nSecond is, if you could discuss on how much is the presence of Campa Cola in your market,?\nBecause what we understand is that it is still in few markets. So if it is in a few markets, how\ncome the impact is there on pan-India business for you?\nMohit Malhotra: Yes. So as far as beverage is concerned, firstly, the season did not favor us. I think without the\nseason, which is more monsoon and flood led. Secondly there was high competitive intensity.\nWhat has happened is that, it didn’t directly impact our business, but the pack price architecture\nand the pricing index has actually become worse.\nSo for us, the 1-litre pack happens to be INR130. And for Colas, the 1-liter pack happens to be\naround INR50. So the price index has gone up to 2.7 from something around 2.1. So going\nforward, we'll be increasing our value proposition to the consumers by introducing INR100 price\npoints in the 1-litre category. This is on the 1 litre.\nAs far as out-of-home consumption is concerned, which is INR10 price point, Campa Cola is at\nINR10 now. And even the big players like Varun and HCCB are also looking to cut the prices\nand will be available at INR15 price point. We have a Tetra Pak, which is available at INR20.\nSo we've introduced INR10 bottle. We've introduced INR20 bottle. We've introduced INR65\nbottle and also now 1 litre. is also available, and 2 litre. will also be available. So we are trying\nto plug all price points with juice-based drinks across.\nAs far as the impact is concerned, I cannot directly correlate the impact, but we can feel a little\nbit of shift in this coming season from juice-based beverages to fizz-based drinks. Firstly, the\nsummer was a little bit acute and therefore, people preferred refreshment-based drinks rather\nthan health based. But I think that was more momentary and transitory because of the price. So\nthere is an impact, but it's an indirect impact of carbonated drinks on the juices.\nAbneesh Roy: Mohit, two quick follow-ups here. One, in terms of the shift from the juice towards the fizz,\nwould that be structural in nature? I know you are taking multiple steps to overcome it. One is\nif you could comment on margins, how it impacts because if you are becoming more sharper in\nterms of pricing, provided nothing changes, say, in raw material. What happens on margins?\nSecond, the awareness quotient clearly is increasing for customers. So the perception is though\nits fruit juice, but it is sweet. And the fruit content, obviously, people can easily read on the pack.\nAnd you also said that in the fizzy drink clearly, because it is so hot and so warm, there is a\nrequirement.\nPage 5 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nSo even if that is also sweet and maybe the non-sugar-wise anyway, that issue is not there. So\nI'm asking, is this a structural issue of more focus on health, so awareness is there. So do you\nneed much more in terms of the R&D aspect to overcome it rather than just pricing? And what\nhappens on the margins given the sharper pricing, which you have taken?\nMohit Malhotra: As far as margins are concerned, the margins in the total juice portfolio have actually moved up.\nAnd that has happened because of the premiumisation at one end and also introducing the price\npoints, which are more value offering to consumers on the other end. So both are kind of going\nhand-in-hand for us. So we've introduced coconut water also, so which are margin accretive to\nus. We've introduced value-added juices also, which are accretive to us, etc. So that is like kind\nof balancing our margin.\nAnd overall, our margins have actually moved up. As far as our representation in drinks, fizz\nand carbonated is concerned, we are also pivoting ourselves to have representation in carbonated\nand in drinks. So that has given us good benefit. As you know, we've got a INR200 crores\nbusiness, which is a drinks portfolio and our fizz-based business, fruit-based fizz drinks for us\nhas also done very well.\nWe've also introduced cans in Jammu, test marketed it and this has also done exceedingly well\nin the marketplace. So I think, A) pivoting the business towards refreshment besides health is\nthere, B) Fruit plus fizz which is the second vector of growth.\nComing to if there is a structural change? I don't think there is a structural change. If you look\nat overall big picture, a 50,000 ft -level view, you would find that the penetration of juices or\nfruit-based beverages in India is still 8% as compared to 25% in China. And that is the example\nthat I can give you from our neighbouring markets.\nSo I don't think there's a structural shift because the penetration of juices is still so low in the\ncountry and fruit is definitely considered more nourishing than only flavoured waters. So that's\nwhat my take would be.\nAbneesh Roy: Sir, last quick question. So this inventory correction you have done, I wanted to ask on that. So\nclearly, FMCG companies keep doing it. The issue was that the quantum was extremely high.\nAnd we have not seen any other consumer company even talking about it currently. So what is\ndifferent about your business since you are also very diversified. I understand in juice business\nthere was a clear 2 quarters of issue. But how come it impacts overall business and the quantum\nif you can discuss that?\nSecond, you mentioned in the coming quarters, the growth will come back to normal. You also\nsaid that urban slowdown has bottomed out. Now other companies are not saying that. They are\nsaying this is start and so we need to watch out. So what is your confidence of saying urban has\nbottomed out? Is it because you have taken the correction or it's more of a company-specific\nthing you are highlighting?\nMohit Malhotra: So first, let me answer your second question first. I think as far as urban is concerned, why I say\nit has bottomed out is because if you look at the base effect, base quarter of urban was very high.\nPage 6 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nIt's already gone down to around 2.8% kind of a growth in FMCG urban that we are seeing. I\ndon't think so it's going to go beyond bottoming out from here.\nAnd if you really look at the intrinsic urban consumption, which is also driven by e-commerce,\nquick commerce, modern trade, etc, these channels are definitely showing a high growth, and\nthey now contribute around 24% of the overall salience of our business. That is growing at a\nvery high double digit, and that is 50% of the urban consumption as far as we are concerned. So\nthat is showing no tell-tale signs of diminishing. So that is where I'm coming from. It's already\nbottomed out even in GT.\nSo whether the consumption is happening through GT or through these emerging channels,\nsomething. So that's what my take would be that it has bottomed out. And as far as rural is\nconcerned, rural remains resilient, and we see secondary growth in rural higher than urban by\naround 130 bps for us. But if I look at the Nielsen data, our growth in rural is 600 basis points\nhigher as compared to urban. So rural remains resilient and urban, in my view, should start\nrecovering with the festive season.\nAnd we've seen the kharif acreage is also high. So that augurs well for rural, and there has been\nMSP increases on the Rabi crop also, which should give more disposable income in the hands\nof the consumer. But food inflation is something which is worrying me, which is in the range of\naround 9% and which is shifting the monies from discretionary to more essential items. So that\nwas the first part of your question.\nAs far as the extent of inventory correction is concerned, now extent of inventory correction was\nhigh, yes. We were deciding to take this inventory correction. But when we press the pedal on\nthe 25th till that time, our business was doing very well. Our HPC business till the 25th of\nSeptember, HPC was growing at 9%; Health Care was growing at 8%; overall business was\ngrowing at 6% and beverage business was declining in secondary by 11%. So beverage business\nis the one which exacerbated the whole issue of inventory for us. And generally, beverage which\nis low shelf life product is high, as compared to HPC and HC businesses which have the 3-years\nof shelf life whereas beverage has only 6-month shelf life. It occupies a lot of space at the\ndistributor end as well.\nSo, the inventory piles up and the pressure is then felt on HC and HPC business because the\nentire ecosystem revolves around targets. So people have to do their numbers. So if one vertical\ndoesn't fire, they try to push in the other vertical and therefore, inventory piles up. So when we\ntook correction, the correction happened across the board for the entire portfolio, but more so in\nthe beverage business. That's why optically the quantum is looking high for you.\nMihir Shah from Nomura\nMihir Shah: So I wanted to check, would it be fair to assume that the GT inventory correction is now behind\ncompletely and 3Q will be a normal growth quarter? And what according to you is normal\ngrowth in volume and value terms in the second half? So that's my first question.\nMohit Malhotra: Yes. So I think inventory correction is behind us. Whatever inventory correction we had to do,\nwe quickly did it in 1 month only rather than prolonging this pain for a long time. It's like a\nPage 7 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\ndisease is better to cure and correct it in one go. That we have done. So we've done corrections,\nbut for health care business, which was preseason, and therefore, we loaded Chyawanprash, so\nthat is not compromised at all. In second half, we expect to grow back in mid- to high single-\ndigits.. This is subject to good winters and FMCG also doing well.\nWe will continue to grow ahead of the category and gain market share. So on the the overall\nstrategy and big picture, I think matrices are fine. Our market shares are going up, household\npenetrations are moving up our distribution is expanding. This is one-off correction, spring\ncleaning that we have done, and that too only on behest of our distributors, so that our ROI of\nthe distributors improves. And that's the feedback that we got. So very strong fundamentals of\nthe business, which do not change at all.\nMihir Shah: Got it. I see the market shares are going up and maybe the inflationary environment is also kind\nof helping that from the unorganized players. But is it fair to assume that given Dabur's rural\nsaliency and winter saliency is high and La Nina here, you should be geared to be a key\nbeneficiary, and grow ahead of the markets and peers? I just wanted to get a confirmation on\nthat.\nMohit Malhotra: Yes, absolutely. I have no doubts about it. I think we should be going ahead of the market with\nLa Nina here. I hope the winter is strong, more severe and more protracted so that Chyawanprash\nbusiness does well for us. We also have plans to recover our beverage business, which is a little\npain point at the moment.\nMihir Shah: Understood. Secondly, Mohit, if you can just deep dive a little bit on the hair care portfolio, the\nhair oils, particularly. If you can give any qualification or quantification on how your Dabur\nAmla has done? And how do you see that portfolio shaping up?\nMohit Malhotra: Yes. So in hair oils, we are market leaders in the perfume category. As you know, we've got\nrepresentation in perfumed oils where we have Dabur Amla and Dabur Amla has got this ring-\nfenced by the flanker brands, which is Sarson Amla, Badam Amla, etc. So the ring-fence brands\npromise economy to the consumer and therefore unbranded shift to those branded oils. Dabur\nAmla is our cash cow and that we are protecting from competitor, which is half the price here.\nAnd therefore, the flanker brands come in. We've done well in hair oils and perfumed hair oils,\nwherein we've gained around 120 bps in perfumed hair oil. So there is Amla, there's Sarson\nAmla, then there is almond oil where also we have gained market shares from a single largest\nplayer in the market. Plus, we launched cooling oils in the market, Cool King. Cool King this\nyear will be around INR25 crores, and it's actually doing very well and the reception from the\nmarket is fantastic.\nSo what we are doing is that we have a right to win in hair oils, and we are trying to plug. We\nare trying to have representations in different subsegments of hair oils. So Cool King, we\nplugged organically. And with Sesa coming in, we'll be plugging the Ayurvedic segment. On\nhair oils, we make a gross margin of around 44%.\nWith Sesa coming in, it comes at around 57% gross margins. And those gross margins are\ncoming without the scale of procurement of Sesa Private Care as a company. With the scale of\nPage 8 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nDabur, we feel that we'll be able to take up the gross margins even further. If you look at the\nprice points in the market, if Amla is at INR0.45 per mL, this is at INR1.7 per ml. And so is\nKesh King at INR1.7 per ml. Indulekha sits at around INR4.7 per ml..\nSo getting the leverage from our scale of procurement, I think this gross margins of 57% is also\nunder-pitched. So this is plugging our premiumization strategy. This is plugging our white space\nstrategy and solidifying and consolidating our core business of hair oils. Plus it also has\nopportunity in international business, which contributes to 25% of our hair oils.\nFor Sesa brand, international business is only 11%. So that will critically go up to around 25%.\nBut I think that's huge. Like if we do around INR1,600 crores in India, we do overall around\nINR2,000 crores portfolio of hair oils we have in the overall kitty and Sesa will only add on to\nthat.\nYes. Coconut oils, which is another subsegment for us, grew by around 14%, and we've gained\nmarket share. The market leader took price increases in coconut oil due to the inflation and so\ndid we. The gross margins also inched up there in the coconut oils. So Sesa can play in two\ncategories for us. One is coconut-based ayurvedic oils.\nOther is perfume-based ayurvedic oils. So we would want to compete in both the subcategories\nwherever the consumer need is, somewhere the consumer need is pre-bath, somewhere the\nconsumer need is post bath. Different markets have different consumer behaviours, and we\nwould want to plug that gap here. So overall, in both the subsegments of coconut and perfume,\nwe've gained market shares. So, on back of market shares, we feel the growth in this category\nfor us will be higher as compared to the market growth rate.\nSo this acquisition should not be seen from point of view of that the hair oil category. It's a low-\ngrowth category. It's been stagnant for the past 3-4 years, and therefore, why this acquisition.\nThe real rationale for acquisition is we are a INR2,000 crores business, and we want to solidify\nthis business as it's a core business, we have market shares of 16%, and we have huge headroom\nfor growth in terms of market share gain. That is the way we see it, and that's the lens with which\nwe want you to have a look at this.\nSuch distribution, if you look at Dabur's distribution is 45 lakh outlets where hair oil goes to, the\nSesa brand only reaches out to around 6 to 6.5 lakhs thereabout. In terms of direct distribution\nalso, they are available in 1.2 to 1.3 lakh outlets. We are available in around 3.5 to 4 lakh outlets.\nSo, I think each of the places, we have miles to go. Plus the penetration of ayurvedic hair oils,\nwhich are therapeutic hair oils, is only around 6% to 7%. And if you look at the overall market,\nthe instance of perception of a hair problem or a hair fall is 60% and the penetration is only 6%\nwith a huge headroom to grow here. Plus, there is an extendibility of the brand. If you look at\nmost of the market players like Indulekha and Kesh King, 20% of their business comes from\nshampoo business.\nAnd shampoo is a huge market, again with a high growth rate there of around 6% to 7%. 20%\nof the market is shampoo market, which is extended from ayurvedic. So this theoretically can\nPage 9 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nalso be extended there. Around 8% of Sesa's business is coming from shampoo. That also has\nhuge legs to grow and hair fall, shampoo can be a very big opportunity.\nMihir Shah: Mohit. Great to know it is quite ring-fenced and seems to be like a good acquisition. My last\nquestion is actually on the health supplement business. You did mention Chyawanprash grew\nby 12%, and that was a bit of a relief as well. Do you expect this continue? Because if you see\nover the past 3 years, on an absolute basis, the Chyawanprash or health supplement absolute\nnumbers has stagnated. Do you expect growth to finally pick up in the second half in the winter\nin the health supplements business? And which ones did not do well, which led to overall growth\nto be lower at 2% for health supplements in Q2 if Chyawanprash grew by 12%?\nMohit Malhotra: Yes. So there is a no stop strategy here. So we are having no hold on to anything, whether it's\nadvertising or it's activation or it's trade lubrication. I think we are working on all levers to ensure\nthat Chyawanprash comes back on track and back on the growth path. And hopefully, with La\nNina, I think Chyawanprash should continue to grow. We've done the loading in the\nmarketplace.\nNow we are looking at secondaries to actually pick up in Chyawanprash. We have introduced a\nformat called Khajurprash, which is basically meant for women and handles the iron deficiency\nin women also. Its a very tasty variant as well. I will nudge you all to have it. If we are able to\nsend across the sample to the investor community, we will definitely do the same. So, we've\ndone innovation.\nWe've also introduced small pack of Chyawanprash for trials to be generated at around INR65\npack for increasing the penetration. In Q2, we did a monsoon campaign to promote\nChyawanprash's all-weather consumption. Chyawanprash has a perception that it's good only in\nwinters. So, to kind of demystify that Chyawanprash is an all-weather friend for building\nimmunity, we did the monsoon campaign and monsoon campaign gave us great dividends in\nterms of this 12% growth that you see. So yes, we're keeping our fingers crossed that\nAvi Mehta from Macquarie\nAvi Mehta: Just first bit was on the margin side. With inventory correction largely driving almost 100 basis\npoints contraction in reported margins at the operating level and a move towards giving higher\nvalue, could you help us understand how should we look at FY '25 margins?\nAnkush Jain: Yes. I think widely at an H1 level, it is almost 100 bps correction. And now at least with some\ntop line improvement foreseen in H2 with hopefully good winters and if the top line happens to\nthe level of mid- to high single digits, then I think we should be able to leverage cost and protect\nmargins for H2, So almost flattish margins at this level in H2. That will be our intent at least.\nAvi Mehta: Fairly clear, fairly clear on that. And the second bit is on the Sesa acquisition. Now while I\nunderstand the strategic rationale, could you help me understand the EPS impact over the next\nfew years? Because it seems at least on year 1, there is dilution, but you did point towards\nsynergies. Could you give us a sense on what are the synergies quantum that you're looking over\nhere?\nPage 10 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nAnkush Jain: I think what will happen is, the process will go into some bit of merger and regulatory approval.\nIt will take at least 1.5 to 2 years. The next 1.5 years, there will be no impact on Dabur EPS to\nstart with. Post that, we feel that once most of the synergies start coming in, the operating margin\nshould inch up to 18% to 19%, which is similar to Dabur once the complete synergies get in.\nAvi Mehta: Okay. Perfectly clear. And sorry, with your permission just a clarification. The mid- to high\nsingle-digit growth comment in the second half is on volume basis and the pricing growth of 2%\nodd expectation should sustain. That is correct, right?\nMohit Malhotra: Yes. We have a price increase of around 1.5% that we've done in H1, but the price increase\nimpact got diluted by the trade and the extra value that we give on the top line. So that has kind\nof got nullified. So, it's a mid- to high single-digit kind of a growth rate that we are looking.\nIt all depends upon how the market kind of behaves and grows. To the previous question, Avi,\nwant to mention that Sesa business is really gross margin accretive, operating margin accretive\nand will provide leverage on all the cost heads to our hair oil portfolio, which is today giving me\nan operating margin of low double digit, which will end up giving me a high double-digit\noperating margin. So it will be a positive leverage on the operating margin for us.\nAvi Mehta: Okay, that's very clear, Mohit. Perfect. Thanks a lot for this and wish you all a very happy festive\nseason. Thank you very much.\nHarit Kapoor from Investec\nHarit Kapoor: I just had two questions. One is on the improving the ROI for the distributor part. So there are\nother ways as well in terms of credit periods etc, or probably at a numerator level, even taking\nthe margin. Just wanted to know, have any of those other pieces also been moved or it's only\nbeen reducing the inventory pipeline? And if it's only inventory days reduction at the distributor\nlevel, what's the quantum of that? And is it fair to assume that since you started this on 25th\nSeptember, it was 6 days reduction?\nMohit Malhotra: So the ROI of distributor will be improved on back of the number of days of inventory that he's\ncarrying. He was carrying inventory of 30 days. And as we speak after the correction, it will be\naround 21 days of inventory.\nSo, ROI substantially improves for him. The turnover remaining the same and the inventory\ncorrection will reduce the amount of investment that he has in the business. And therefore, there\nwill be an improvement in the ROI. That is what I think the question was. I hope I've been able\nto answer.\nHarit Kapoor: Yes. Just the question was really apart from this 9-day reduction, has there anything else been\ndone, whether it's credit periods or overall percentage margin, etc?\nMohit Malhotra: Yes. For the past couple of months, we've been giving a little extra credit to the distributors also.\nSo that has also gone up. Because the inventory was high, there was inability on part of the\ndistributor to extend that extra credit in the marketplace also because he watches his ROI etc. So\nPage 11 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nI think that trade extensions will also go down, which we were offering earlier. The number\nthree lever is that a lot of stockists used to have stockist salesmen on their payroll.\nWe shifted them from their payroll to a third-party payroll, which is a team lease payroll, and\nsome part of the margin was given back to them to improve their ROI also. So all that is also\nhappening alongside. Plus this phenomena of ROI reduction is more in urban India rather than\nrural India. So in urban, we are also providing some sort of subsidy to our distributors to ensure\ntheir ROIs come in.\nAs far as rural is concerned, there's not too much of pain because the cost of doing business is\nmuch lower in rural as compared to urban. And urban also the shoe is pinching of the distributors\nbecause of the quick commerce and the e-commerce surge, which is happening. And some part\nis the price conflict, and some part is also offtake from the retail outlets in urban India going\ndown and therefore, the inventory piling up, which will get corrected as we have reduced the\ninventory.\nAnd going forward, we are also looking at a way to do some sort of consolidation of distributors\nin urban India and not so much in rural. In rural, we will look at expansion of distribution, get\ninto more number of villages and small towns and expand our distribution, divide our\ndistribution into HPC, HC and foods and for urban looking at more consolidation.\nHarit Kapoor: Got it. But any of these incremental initiatives over the next 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, in\nyour view, should not have a material impact on the business from a disruption standpoint?\nMohit Malhotra: No, I don't think there's any disruption in business. No, not at all. I don't think so. This was one-\noff. And this one-off also we've done in almost 20 years. Dabur has never done it. And this is\nlike a spring cleaning of the house, which was warranted once in a decade at least. So yes, maybe\nafter a decade or so, you might expect it, I might not be there. So I don't think we foresee this\nhappening again.\nHarit Kapoor: Sure, sure. I'm not so sure if I'll be on a call after a decade as well, so. The second thing was on\nSesa. So you've very clearly mapped out the rationale. I just wanted to get your sense on how\nare you thinking of kind of category growth because certain interactions that we have for the top\ntwo players in this space also suggest that their growths have not been so flattering. So I'm sure\nyou've kind of seen that when you evaluated this.\nI also see basis your numbers that there was a slightly lower rate of growth last year for this\nentity. So that's my first question on Sesa. And the second one really is on the geographic mix,\nwhich part of the market does it have a higher salience?\nMohit Malhotra: Yes. So as far as Sesa is concerned, I told you there are a couple of levers that make us so\nconfident that we will continue to grow and grow at a higher pace, higher growth than what our\nhair oils is actually growing. It's a national brand, unlike Badshah that we acquired, which is\nmore of a Western brand, and their contribution is very complementary to us. Their contribution\ncomes from Central, which is the mainstay of Dabur, which is UP, Bihar, etc, at 30%\ncontribution.\nPage 12 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nWest, which is low for Dabur, they are high, which is 27% contribution coming from there. They\nare over-skewed on chemist channel and less skewed on grocery channel where Dabur is high\nskewed on grocery and less skewed on chemist. So that provides opportunity as far as we are\nconcerned. North for them is 11%, for Dabur is skewed at around 25%, which is double. There,\nthere is upside from our distribution is concerned.\nEast, they are around 20% contribution and for Dabur is about the same. And South, they are\nhigher skewed, 11% contribution in South and Dabur hair oil has low contribution coming from\nSouth and ayurvedic hair oils tend to be more salient in South. In Bangladesh, where Dabur is\nlow, they have a higher presence. They are market leaders with 90% market share in the\nayurvedic segment in Bangladesh. So they will help, and it's a coconut market.\nSo there, they help us to premiumize our entire portfolio in Bangladesh. Middle East, which is\na huge 25% contributor to our overall global hair oil business, they are not present in Middle\nEast. So that entire place is up for taking. We have the RTM and the GTM established in around\n20 countries in Middle East, where they have zero presence whatsoever. So that's the upside that\nwe have. In terms of sheer numbers, we have a direct reach of around 3 lakh to 4 lakh outlets.\nThey have a direct reach of 1.2 lakh. So this direct reach immediately in our control.\nThe moment we bolt on the distribution to our distribution. And the indirect distribution is\naround 6 lakhs as compared to us being around 45 lakhs. And this category will have to be\nadvertised, and the high gross margins allow that kind of advertising to be done there. They've\ngot 300-odd distributors. We have got around 3,000 distributors. So their presence in rural is\nlow. Our presence in rural with sub-stockist and Yodha network is extremely high. So I think all\nthese are very synergistic sort of opportunities, which we saw.\nAnd it's a premium hair oil and the extension possibilities are many, can be extended into\nshampoo, into serums, etc. And hair care, I told you an instance of 60% of problem solution, and\nthey solve the problem solution space in the benefit segmentation in the consumer's mind. So all\nthese things work in our favor. Did I miss out any point of your question? I don't know.\nHarit Kapoor: No, fair point. If I have anything, I'll come back.\nPrakash Kapadia from Spark PMS\nPrakash Kapadia: Two questions from my end. Mohit, you alluded to food inflation being a big concern in urban\ndemand. So any sense you could give us on down trading by consumers? Is LUP increasing?\nAnd you obviously mentioned you feel that from here on, growth should come back. So what's\nthe outlook on urban demand coming back? That's the first question.\nAnd secondly, earlier for us and for most of the players in the FMCG business, GT was the real\nmoat, direct and indirect partially, then came modern trade and then e-commerce and now it's\nquick commerce. So what does the future lie in terms of distribution and sustainable moat for us\nand your thoughts?\nMohit Malhotra: Right. So I'll answer your first question, Prakash. So as far as urban is concerned, why I'm saying\nis urban has bottomed out because urban at the same time last year was growing at 11%. Now\nPage 13 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nit's come down to 2.8%. I don't think urban demand will go down. The last urban demand went\ndown was during the COVID time to around minus 2%, 3%. And that was under the COVID\ntime.\nAfter that, I think 2.8% is the most bottom kind of demand that I've seen. And if you look at\nsequentially, I think the volumes in urban have grown sequentially from 2.1% in Quarter 1 is\nnow to 2.8%. If you look at the same period last year in quarter 3, the urban demand was 7.7%;\nfrom 7.7% on that base, I think it will be somewhere in the range of around 3%, 3.5%. And so I\nthink rural and urban both will inch up like they've inched up. So it's a base effect also, which is\nkind of kicking in here, and we see urban demand picking up from here. And so the rural\nresilience is going to be picking up.\nNow coming to food inflation, food inflation is definitely high. If you look at all the subsegments\nof FMCG growth, we find food is the one which is growing on back of value, on back of price\nincreases, whether it's food, non-staples, or food staples. The rest, Home Care, OTC, and\nPersonal Care by far have remained flat. So I think with urban bottoming out, I see some amount\nof growth coming in even in the discretionary categories also.\nAnd as I told you, the acreage is higher, MSPs have gone up, so hopefully, food inflation should\nalso tame going forward. And government has also called out on the food inflation. So there will\nbe steps that the government will also take to tame the food inflation.\nThe second part is modern trade, e-commerce, and quick commerce. I think one fundamental\nthing which is happening in India is that GT as a percentage salient will go down and e-\ncommerce driven by quick commerce will only grow in the country. So what we are doing is\nthat we are strengthening our relationship and bondages with e-commerce and quick commerce\nplayers and doing joint business planning with them, creating new products for them, connecting\nwith them on a monthly, quarterly basis and seeing that we continuously grow shares in quick\ncommerce and e-commerce portals, be it marketplaces like Amazon, Flipkart or be it quick\ncommerce channel like Swiggy, Instamart, Blinkit and Zepto. Our growth there is higher than\ntheir FMCG growth. So if they have grown by 50%, we've grown by 70% with them on their\nverticals.\nSo we are ensuring that we grow market shares, and we continuously launch innovations which\nare very customized to these customers. As far as modern trade is concerned, our visibility is\nstill little muted in modern trade and therefore on back of investment in modern trade and on\nback of gaining market shares from other players, I think modern trade for us should also\ncontinuously grow.\nBut the quick commerce players are putting pressure on modern trade also besides GT. So if you\nlook at the results of DMart and Reliance Retail, they are also a little under pressure today\nbecause the quick commerce and e-commerce is actually putting pressure on them also, and they\nwould also be pivoting on multi-ways of distribution, whether it's electronically or through\noffline, etc.\nPage 14 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nSo going forward, this gradual change from GT to MT to e-commerce is something which will\nendure. I don't think this is a flash in the pan and will disappear. I think this is enduring here,\nand this change will come. And how fast, we will have to watch. But GT is a very integral part\ntoday and will continue to be integral part because rural is a huge part of India. So at one end,\nwe would be wanting to consolidate in urban India and other end, we would want to extend our\ndistribution in rural.\nSo keep expanding rural with sub-stockist and Yodha channel which provide visibility to our\nbusiness there so that assortment would go up, increase our direct reach in urban smaller cities,\nincrease our direct reach in rural to have visibility and better assortment, reduce our reliance on\nwholesale and increase our direct reach. That is the fundamental strategy for rural and semi-\nurban markets. For metro markets, 8, 10 cities, I think, will keep expanding along with the quick\ncommerce portals as they expand from 10 cities to 20 cities to maybe 100 cities going forward.\nSorry for a long answer, but yes.\nPrakash Kapadia: No, that's helpful. So what essentially you are alluding to is work with them and try and be part\nof that and do customization and see what sells and how much we can participate in that growth\nto adapt to this, right?\nMohit Malhotra: Absolutely. Yes.\nPrakash Kapadia: Fine. At least on the urban side. And rural still, I think the GT would continue to play a larger\nrole.\nMohit Malhotra: In terms of villages, we reach out to 1,20,000 villages. Headroom is to go up to 6 lakh villages\nin the country. So huge headroom there. And in direct reach also, overall, Dabur's direct plus\nindirect is 84 lakh outlets. We only go to something around 15 lakh outlets. So where is 15 lakh,\nand we should be minimum around 30% of 84 lakhs, so around 25 lakhs, and we are only in\naround 15 lakhs. So we can double our direct reach also.\nPercy Panthaki from IIFL Securities\nPercy Panthaki: I just wanted to know after this pipeline correction, what is the distributor days now?\nMohit Malhotra: Around 21 days, and we want to bring it down to around 19 days by end of December.\nAnkush Jain: And maybe just to add on even with 21 days, it's slightly on the higher side because we have\nloaded bit of Chyawanprash to take care of season.\nPercy Panthaki: Okay. So even in Q3, basically, the primary will be lower than secondary by 2% approximately?\nMohit Malhotra: No, no.\nPercy Panthaki: So then how will 21 come down to 19 then Mohit?\nAnkush Jain: These inventory days are based on forward cover. Hence, even in December end, we expect it\nto bring it to 19 to 20 days, maybe around 20 days.\nPage 15 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nPercy Panthaki: Okay. On beverages, I just wanted to understand where the largest impact is. So you have the\nfruit drinks portfolio, then you have the nectars and then you have the juices. So where is the\nimpact the most? I would assume it is in the fruit drinks, but just correct me if I'm wrong there.\nAnd secondly, the drinks that we had ventured into in a material way some 3 or 4 years ago, I\nbelieve in the first year, we had crossed INR100 crores, etc. So versus what was the peak\nturnover that we did in juices? And versus that, what is the sort of number that we are likely to\ndo in FY '25?\nMohit Malhotra: Okay. Let me answer this question. Our complete beverage portfolio is divided into 4 parts. Now\nfirst part is coconut water. Our coconut water, we were struck by Storia last year, who came out\nwith a PET bottle. So just to tell you, it's a good news that we've bounced back by giving a lot\nof value in coconut water and the market shares have gone up by 200 basis points. The overall\nActiv Coconut portfolio has increased by 16% in terms of secondary.\nSo that's one part of the portfolio. The active 100% juices for us has not got impacted by the\nseason. I think this is premium portfolio for us, which is 7.3% growth, which quarter to August\nwas also growing by around 18%, 19% for us, and it's the most margin-accretive portfolio. So\nthat is the second part of the portfolio.\nThe third part of the portfolio is a drinks portfolio. which registered a turnover of around INR200\ncrores. In the current year, we've got a growth of around 16% in this portfolio. But the 16%\ngrowth is excluding East, where we were the hardest hit because of the Northeast. Our per capita\nconsumption of juices is the highest in Northeast in India, highest. And Northeast was reeling\nunder floods in the quarter 2, and that was a wettest monsoon that we could see in the Northeast,\nand that was hit. Minus Northeast, our growth was 16%, 17%. Northeast impacted and the\ngrowth became negative to around 8%.\nBut drinks is not what has got impacted so much. The real impact which has happened in the\nNectar business. Our Nectar business has declined by minus 12%. So drinks, Activ Coconut and\nReal Fizz which is the carbonated portfolio. Carbonated portfolio grown by 100% for us. So\ntherefore, there's a tailwind towards carbonate, albeit very small for us, but around 70%, 80% of\nthe portfolio is Real Nectar, which is where we got impacted the most, which declined by around\n12%.\nPercy Panthaki: And that decline is basically customers' preferences towards more cheaper alternatives? Or is\nthere anything else towards that decline?\nMohit Malhotra: I think the entire category declined by around 8.6% in terms of volume. We gained a market\nshare of 230 bps. So, if you compare to relative performance vis-a-vis Tropicana or Slice or B-\nNatural, Real is surely a preferred choice among the consumer in the juices and nectars' market.\nSo market shares have gone up. So it's a very good sign. So in Nielsen data, we've grown higher\nthan the category. That's one. But category itself is declining.\nSo I think Tetra pack is moving to bottles. The consumer preference is they want to see what\nthey are having. So in Tetra pack, we've launched a 1-litre bottle. We have launched a 2-litre\nbottle. We've launched a 500 mL bottle and there is a 200 mL bottle also at all price points of\nPage 16 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nINR10, INR20, INR100. That is the price point that we have plugged with nectars as well. So\nthat should take care of the problem.\nPercy Panthaki: Is the problem in Nectar is that the average price per litre. or per 100 or 200 mL, whatever you\ncount it, that is much more expensive versus some of the cheaper options like colas, etc, as you\ncalled out that Campa is sort of giving a lot more value, although it's not a comparable product,\nbut it's like an imperfect substitute. And therefore, people are saying that this is not something\nthat is affordable in light of the other options available in the market, and that's why this category\nis declining. Is that understanding, correct?\nMohit Malhotra: Yes, that is a correct understanding. There is a price difference because Campa for 1 litre., which\nis a party pack and in-home consumption is available at a INR45 –and forget Campa, even Pepsi\nor Coke is available at around INR50 for a 1-litre price point. And as compared to Real, which\nis 70% market share player, it's available at INR130. So there is a definite difference between\nthe 2 things, yes.\nPercy Panthaki: But Mohit, if this is the reason, then what is the solution? Because then we don't see an end in\nsight, and this can keep declining for many more quarters. So is there an end in sight? And is\nthere a solution if this is the root cause?\nMohit Malhotra: So therefore, the solution to this is we have pivoted into drinks. Drinks are pegged at a similar\nprice point as soft drinks. That's exactly what I explained to you, INR10, INR20, INR50 and\nINR100 price point, drink is pegged at par with the carbonated and fruit-based fizz drinks are\nalso at par. That said, it is a small base. So therefore, it cannot compensate for the 80% of the\nNectar business. We have to provide value in the Nectar business also. Therefore, we are\nintroducing a INR100 tropical juices in nectars.\nAnd also, we are planning to give a value on Nectar by giving a tangible goody there. So that is\nwhat we are trying to do. But I think it's a matter of time before the pricing will get normalized\nand this cola war should end, and we have been a little collateral damage in this cola war for\npast 6 months or so. But I don't think that is the only problem. I think it's more monsoon and\nseason, which created havoc for beverage.\nPercy Panthaki: Got it, Mohit. That's all from me. Thanks and all the best.\nKunal Vora from BNP Paribas\nKunal Vora: First question on Namaste litigation, how much did you spend in first half? And what's the status\nnow? How much longer do you expect to continue spending on it?\nAnkush Jain: Yes. So in fact, in first half, we have spent around INR40 crores to INR45 crores, and we expect\naround INR85 crores to INR90 crores in full year. Last year, it was INR110-odd crores on a\nyearly basis. So there is a reduction in cost because there has been some optimization, not only\nin terms of lawyers, but also in terms of their management and more optimization of the lawyers.\nMohit Malhotra: So therefore, we've got a INR20-30 crores of saving from last year's base on the litigation cost\non Namaste. That said, this is all a provision that we are keeping in our books. As the insurance\nPage 17 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\ncompany gives us a guarantee to pay, this part of this provision can be reversed depending upon\nthe case that we are fighting.\nKunal Vora: Understood. And is there a visibility on when does this end?\nAnkush Jain: We think around 1.5 years from now is the best estimate which we have got from various lawyers\ninteraction. But knowing U.S., it can do plus/minus 6 months or thereabouts.\nKunal Vora: Understood. Second is, how do you supply to quick commerce? How does it work? Are you\nsupplying directly or through distributors? And how are the margins offered to quick commerce\ncompanies versus like overall portfolio? And as the distribution, which was like fragmented\nearlier through GT, now like there is a consolidation happening with modern trade and e-\ncommerce, especially in cities. Is there a risk which you see to the margins?\nMohit Malhotra: Yes. So we guys used to supply to quick commerce and modern trade through our GT stockist.\nBut I think around 1.5 years back, we've started direct supplies to the quick commerce players.\nLet's take an example of Blinkit, so we supply from our side to the Blinkit warehouses. There\nare roughly around 20 to 30 warehouses they have. From those 20 warehouses, they supply to\n500 to 600 dark stores. From the dark stores, it goes to the consumer.\nSo that's the supply chain which is there, from us to the quick commerce players, all of them,\nwhether it's Zepto or a Blinkit or it is Swiggy. As far as margins are concerned, our margins are\naround 100 to 200 basis points higher in quick commerce as compared to e-commerce\nmarketplaces. And moreover, compared to GT also, our margins are higher because we sell\nlarger packs to them and TOTs are better as compared to modern trade.\nKunal Vora: Understood. But how do you see this consolidation happening on the other side, modern trade,\ne-commerce, they become larger, they will have like higher bargaining power. Do you think this\ncan be a longer-term risk to the margin?\nMohit Malhotra: Yes, we used to think that there could be a consolidation. But knowing India, I think question of\nconsolidation doesn't arise. Now everybody is pivoting towards being a quick commerce player.\nSo if you look at big basket is also a quick commerce, and Amazon is also wanting to become a\nbig quick commerce. Tata is becoming a quick commerce. You heard the news today. So I think\none after the other, there will be many players. Flipkart has introduced ‘Minutes’ as a quick\ncommerce player.\nSo therefore, there will be multiple quick commerce players and the bargaining power shifting\nin their hands is very difficult when there are many players. So I think it will remain in our hands\nonly, and there are so many manufacturers. So as the market democratizes and more and more\nquick commerce players come in, I think because of the competitive intensity, margins will be\nwhere they are. So I don't think margins will go up.\nKunal Vora: How are the distributors reacting to you supplying directly to various large players like quick\ncommerce and modern trade versus through distributors earlier?\nPage 18 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nMohit Malhotra: As far as distributor is concerned, there is a distributor consortium of All India Consumer\nProduct Distributors Federation. They are up in arms against all these quick and e-comm players,\nand they have made representations to the Commerce Ministry against the predatory pricing\nbecause so many of these quick commerce players are private equity funded and they subsidize\nproducts, come out with events like Big Billion Day etc and they deep discount the products\nwhich become loss leaders and hence attract footfalls for them. And then that disrupts the GT\nmarket.\nAnd as far as the general trade is concerned, they are also the vote bank of the government. So\ngovernment can't afford not to appease them. And that's why you've heard so many articles of\ngovernment against the predatory pricing of these quick commerce players. So I think it's a larger\nquestion there.\nSo obviously, stockists have not taken it in good taste of what's happening on quick commerce.\nBut you can't help it. So you have to bypass the stockist and go to them because their terms of\ntrade and their want of products is such which only company themselves can fulfil. Dark store\nkeeps an inventory of 3 days, not more than 3 days, which distributors can't fill in, which only a\ncompany EDI Direct connect with the Blinkit EDI can fulfil on a replenishment basis in their\nwarehouse. It's not possible for them to supply the entire assortment, which may be required by\nquick commerce players.\nKunal Vora: Understood, very helpful. Thank you, that was from my side.\nShirish Pardeshi from Centrum Stock Broking\nShirish Pardeshi: It was a bit excited to not get into the much deeper on the inventory and other thing. But you\nmentioned in the opening slide, quick commerce growing at a rapid pace. And you just\nmentioned that the dark store inventory is sub minimal at 3, 4 days. So rather than looking at the\nfront end and the distributor connect, do we need to have a breakthrough innovation in the supply\nchain at the back end so that the distributor inventory correction issue will not come in future?\nMohit Malhotra: So I think the back end is supply chain. So on supply chain, we are actually trying to do an\nexperiment with the Blinkit etc, to have a direct connect with them, connecting our internal\nsupply chain of our warehouse to their dark store, but seems very difficult because they keep a\nvery low inventory, and they don't have a backup there. And as far as distributors are concerned,\nwe are trying a model, something like where an app can be given to a distributor or retailer so\nthat direct orders can be sent to us and the delivery and the cash management can happen from\nthe distributor.\nSo we are trying and experimenting multiple models on digital to see how to navigate this\nproblem. But the short-term solve for us was inventory correction and also moving the salesmen\non a third-party payroll and refunding and a little bit of subsidy to be given to them to improve\ntheir profitability. I don't know if I answered your question correctly.\nShirish Pardeshi: Yes. So, having spent time in FMCG at the front end, I was more curious because have you done\nany studies, say, for example, Bombay, Delhi or for example, Bombay, if we would have been\ndoing on an average, about INR25 crores, INR30 crores on a month basis. And there is a quick\nPage 19 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\ncommerce, e-commerce, and modern trade, which is flourishing. Is there an actual demand\nwhich has been getting crushed because I still don't understand people are pointing out the urban\ndemand is coming down. Is there any study or is there any depth you can give me?\nMohit Malhotra: So as far as urban demand is concerned, I don't think urban demand is really coming down.\nOverall, FMCG urban is under pressure because of food inflation that is understood. But this\nurban demand is getting catered through e-commerce and quick commerce because the\nconsumer behaviour is changing to wanting to shop digitally and online and not go to a nearby\nKirana Store.\nAnd what Nielsen does is, which is a syndicated data that the entire industry refers to looking at\nthe consumer demand in urban, they generally track the GT and the pop and mom stores and not\nso much the quick commerce or the e-commerce players. They track MT and they track GT. So\na lot of demand, which is there on e-commerce and quick commerce is perhaps not getting\ncaptured by the data which is there in urban today. So that is also an issue.\nAnkush Jain: Yes. Maybe just to add on, while there's no study on this, but the impulsive purchase because of\nquick commerce probably the demand is actually getting generated, but it's not getting captured.\nThat may be a hypothesis.\nShirish Pardeshi: No, I'm more curious, sorry, I'm hopping on this. Though we have a product portfolio, maybe\nbecause of that, we need to keep our inventory at the higher level. But then if I look back, there\nare so much variation. Certain companies, I don't want to name, they keep an inventory of maybe\nabout 5, 6 days, and there are certain companies who keep the inventory more than a month. So\nthat's what my question was, that at the back-end innovation because we have digital and AI,\nwhich is coming up, so what is the issue to reinvent? Anyway, I'll take it offline.\nMy second question is on the skin care and the health care portfolio, in healthcare specifically\nOTC and Ethical, we are doing better. But in this quarter, the growth rate, which was mentioned\nin the presentation, is flat. So is there a sharper inventory correction, and has it been done\nconsciously?, Is the inventory under control now or we will have further impact on this?\nMohit Malhotra: Okay. Skin care, as far as skin care is concerned, I think the real growth will happen in winter.\nSkin care consumption for us is more winter skewed. So I think we have a winter portfolio, and\nwe expect skin care to actually pick up. As far as market shares are concerned, we've gained\nmarket shares in Fem also, which is more bleaches. So overall, I think skin care is doing okay.\nThe secondaries being down in skin care, I think, was more of a collateral damage because of\nthe inventory correction that we've done. It's a small percentage of our portfolio. And therefore,\nsecondary may have suffered because of that.\nAs far as Health Care is concerned, I think all verticals of Health Care continue to do well for\nus. So I told you Chyawanprash is 12% growth. Even in honey we gained market share, a little\nbit of crystallization problem is behind us. Glucose wasn't salient. Our Baby Care portfolio grew\nby around 30%.. Our Lal Tail continued to grow. Shilajit had a very high double-digit growth.\nHajmola did well under the digestive portfolio.\nPage 20 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nSo I think OTC, digestives, all portfolios did well for us. Now I think if you're talking about\nHonitus, which would have declined a little bit, I think that is on account of the high bases that\nwe have in Honitus. That's why decline was there in Honitus. Otherwise, I think all verticals of\nhealth care did reasonably well.\nShirish Pardeshi: Okay. My last question on the international business, though we have done a very good job\nthere. But is there any further room in terms of margin improvement? Because last time when\nwe had a physical meeting, we were banking on the international business will show some good\nprofitability path.\nMohit Malhotra: Yes. So international business is doing well. And I think one good thing on the margins is that\nour Middle East, North Africa, which is the most margin-accretive geography in the entire region\nis doing well. And we have a lot of innovations, as I was telling you, that Oral Care is something\nthat we are doubling down, and Oral Care profitability is also pretty high in international\nbusiness, that we are doubling down in. Dabur Red is one of the high-priced toothpastes. So I\nthink on back of that, we will expect the margin improvement to happen.\nSo, currency depreciation is something which arises in international. But as we lap over the\ncurrencies, now it's been happening over a year. And if you look at the first half also, we are\ndown by INR181 crores on the currency depreciation. And this currency depreciation is a\ntranslation loss. There is also a transaction loss that happens because a lot of the products in\ninternational are imported by us, and they have to pay a dollar currency for the import of that,\nespecially in Turkey market. So therefore, as we lap over the currencies, I think our margins will\nonly improve in Egypt and in Turkey, which are very high salient markets for us.\nShirish Pardeshi: Okay thank you Mohit and Ankush happy Diwali to you.\nVishal Punmiya from Yes Securities\nVishal Punmiya: Just one question from my side. So historically, we have been a key participator in the Maha\nKumbh Melas. What are your plans for this year? And if you can also talk about the benefits as\nwell as the cost that go behind this event?\nMohit Malhotra: Yes. So I think for us, we are a rural salient company. 50% of the business comes from rural.\nAnd in rural, activations is a very big avenue to touch, feel and experience the product by the\nconsumer. And we are very aggressive in terms of taking hoardings and doing experiential\nmarketing. Last time when Kumbh was there, we did a special RTP campaign in Kumbh and\nhad RTP taps that consumer could come to and take a toothbrush and take RTP on that and use\nit. And the more they try, the more conviction they build in the product and the more they buy.\nSo this year also, we'll be participating in Maha Kumbh. And we also participated in other melas\nlike Pandharpur Mela, Nauchandi Mela etc., which is a very huge congregation of consumers,\nto provide them experience with our product. Now we have Cool King, so we do special\nchumpies in these melas also, do auto branding, van branding, retail branding, stall branding etc.\nVishal Punmiya: Sir, is there any major benefit that comes in? Or is it more lag in terms of demand improvement\nfrom all these events?\nPage 21 of 22\nDabur India Limited\nOctober 30, 2024\nMohit Malhotra: So it's a demand improvement that we get and which results in a better offtake and also sampling.\nSo the more people sample, the more sampling happens, the more cascade effective trials and\ntherefore, repeat purchase and market share moves up. So it's very tangible actually.\nVishal Punmiya: Understood. Just quickly on the high interest cost and other income for the quarter, quickly you\ncan comment on that? That was from my side.\nAnkush Jain: Yes. So first of all, you see other income and interest cost jointly. And if you see it jointly, it is\nalmost 18%. In India, it grew by 7%, but in international, it grew by almost 18% or thereabouts.\nAnd this is primarily because in international geographies, we had some benefit, especially in\nDubai, where some of the yields almost got doubled in certain international markets because of\ninflation and therefore, the interest rates going up. So that was the main reason for other income\nnet increasing by 18%.\nVishal Punmiya: Thank you and happy Diwali to team.\nIsha Lamba: I would like to thank all the participants for joining today's call. The webcast recording and\ntranscript will be available on our website. Thank you and wish you all a Very Happy Diwali.\nPage 22 of 22\n",

On behalf of the management of Dabur India Limited, I welcome you to the Earnings Conference Call pertaining to the results for Q2 FY '25. Present here with me are Mr. Mohit Malhotra, Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ankush Jain, Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Rehan Hasan, Head of Sales; Mrs. Gagan Ahluwalia, VP-Corporate Affairs; and Mr. N. Krishnan, General Manager-Finance. We will start with an overview of the company's performance by Mr. Mohit Malhotra, and this will be followed by a Q&A session. I'll now hand over to Mr. Mohit. Thank you. Mohit Malhotra: Thank you, Isha. Good evening, ladies, and gentlemen. We welcome you to Dabur India Limited's conference call pertaining to results for the quarter ended 30th September 2024. This quarter, the sector faced challenges from heavy monsoons, floods, and high food inflation, which slowed down urban consumption, especially in the beverage category for us. However, rural continues to be resilient and has outpaced urban growth for last 3 quarters. We believe urban consumption has bottomed out and should see an improvement going forward. As new channels have been growing ahead of general trade, this has put some pressure on profitability of our GT channel partners. We recognize the challenging times faced by our GT channel partners who are integral to Dabur and have significantly contributed to building our esteemed business. As part of our commitment to good governance and in solidarity with them, we have undertaken one-time strategic initiative to rationalize inventories and enhance their profitability. As a result, our consolidated revenue declined by 5.5%. While this one-off proactive measure resulted in a temporary dip in sales, this was necessary step to enhance the profitability of our GT distributors and ensure long-term health and hygiene of our business. Our business fundamentals remain strong with all underlining key consumer metrices of market share, household penetration, secondary sales and compounded annual growth on a positive trajectory. Our secondary sales during the quarter grew by 2.3% year-on-year with Home and Personal Care growing at 6%, Health Care growing by 4%. In addition, we gained market share across 95% of our portfolio. The international business exhibited resilience and registered a strong growth of 13% in constant currency terms. Within the domestic business, Home and Personal Care secondary sales grew by around 6%. Hair Oils grew ahead of the category and gained 40 bps market share. We are market leaders in hair oils with representation in both coconut and perfumed hair oils. A key white space has been premium Ayurvedic hair oil segment that we have been calling out for a long time. I'm happy to announce that Dabur has entered into an agreement to merge Sesa Care Private Limited, which has a consolidated turnover of INR133 crores. This proposed merger brings to Dabur the premium Sesa brand with strong credentials around Ayurveda that will complement our existing portfolio and strengthen our presence in the INR14,000 crores hair oil category. Given Dabur's extensive distribution network and category leadership, this transaction will bring in substantial revenue and cost synergies. Sesa brand will also enable us to premiumize our hair  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 oil portfolio as it is gross margin accretive. International businesses contribute to 19% of overall Sesa’s sales with Sesa being number 1 Ayurvedic therapeutic hair oil in Bangladesh market. Home Care portfolio continued on a strong growth trajectory with 9% year-on-year secondary sales growth and market share gains of 220 bps in air fresheners and 510 bps in mosquito repellent cream category. We continue to premiumize and expand our product range in Odonil with gel pockets, diffusers, and premium air fresheners. We have extended Odomos brand into liquid vaporizer format, which is seeing an encouraging response from the market. We intend to scale up this during upcoming months. This initiative will enable the Home Care portfolio to grow in double digits going forward in the future, taking up the portfolio from INR700 crores to around INR1,000 crores in 2 to 3 years' timeframe. In oral care category, our flagship brand, Dabur Red recorded secondary sales of around 5%. We have a strong number 2 position in the category with 1 out of every 2 households using Dabur Oral Care products. Dabur Red toothpaste has a number 1 position in states like Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. I'm happy to inform you that Dabur Red has become India's first Ayurvedic toothpaste to get accreditation and recognition from Indian Dental Association, a consortium of allopathic dental practitioners. Going forward, we will ramp up our engagement with dentist community to cover around 1 lakh dentists. Our Health Care segment posted a secondary sales growth of 4%. To promote all-weather consumption of Chyawanprash, we rolled out a special monsoon campaign during the quarter, which has resulted in secondary growth of 12.6% in Chyawanprash. The brand gained 20 bps market share to reach 61%. The Chyawanprash category penetration has improved by 10 lakh households from pre-COVID levels. To drive premiumization, we recently launched the Khajurprash variant, which was very well received by the consumers. Digestives portfolio recorded a secondary growth of 6% year-on- year, led by good growth in Hajmola and market share gains of 160 bps. Dabur Honey also grew ahead of the category and gained market share of 60 bps. Health Juices and Shilajit recorded a year-on-year growth of 20% each and Baby Care portfolio grew by 30%. In Foods category, the business performed well with 20.6% growth in secondary sales. Badshah continued on a strong footing and grew by 15%, both primary and secondary terms, driven by 15% volume growth. Food business, including Badshah, will cross INR500 crores this year, as alluded earlier. We intend to continue to grow Foods vertical aggressively going forward as well. Due to aggressive monsoons leading to floods and landslides in some parts of the country, the Juices and Nectar category declined in high single digits. Despite the slowdown, we grew ahead of the category and gained volume market shares of 240 bps. We have put in place a multipronged strategy of ramping up our drinks portfolio, improving affordability through pack price architecture, revenue growth management and drive premiumization in emerging channels and expanding the distribution footprint to put Juices and Nectars back on the growth trajectory.  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 Coming to profitability, the consolidated gross margins expanded by 102 basis points. The company increased its investment in advertising and promotion and went up from 6.8% of net sales in quarter 2 to 7.4%. However, deleverage on account of decline in revenue impacted the operating profit, which declined by 16.4%. I am pleased to announce that our company's Dow Jones Sustainability Index score has reported 170% improvement from 30 to 81 in last 2 years, reflecting our unwavering commitment to sustainability and responsible governance. I would like to once again reassure you that the underlying business fundamentals remain strong and overall health of the business continues to be robust. With rural growth continuing to be resilient, urban slowdown expected to have bottomed out and riding on the strategic initiatives, we are confident of our performance in the upcoming quarters to be back on track. We remain dedicated to investing behind our brands, expanding our distribution reach, and building our back-end capabilities to continue to deliver superior value creation. With this, I conclude my address and open the floor to Q&A. Thank you. Abneesh Roy from Nuvama Abneesh Roy: My first question is on toothpaste. So we have seen 3 results till now in that space. You have grown by 5% and the market leader has grown in double digits with around 8% volume growth. And the number 3 player has also seen high single-digit growth. So one, how do you see your growth versus the other 2 players? Second, have you seen a sharp ramp-up in the competitive intensity in Q2 and do you see this as a structural development or that was a one-off given the margin pressure which market leader saw? Mohit Malhotra: Right. So Abneesh, overall, Oral Care category is growing quite well. We have grown ahead of the category at around 5% value, and we've gained market shares also in Dabur Red. Besides Dabur Red, even Meswak has performed very well in the quarter. Dabur Herbal toothpaste for us has also been doing very well. Lal Dant Manjan, which is our tooth powder brand, has also grown by 7% in terms of secondary. So all the vectors of oral care for us have done well in the market and market shares have gone well. I can't comment so much on the competitor. But as far as we are there, I think Oral Care is one of the very aggressive vectors, which we will keep pushing to drive our growth. On Oral Care, I would want to mention one thing that we are really seeing huge tailwinds on our product portfolio and international business. Oral Care will be one of the second vectors of our growth besides Hair Care in the international business. We have completely saturated our installed capacity in markets like Egypt, MENA etc. on Oral Care, and we are augmenting capacity there. So there is a real heavy tailwind towards herbal, natural and Ayurvedic products in oral care. In many countries, in MENA and in Egypt, we have already become number 2 and number 3 brands placating large global competitors that we have there. As a matter of fact, in Egypt, we've become the number 2 brand in Oral Care, and we are putting up special installed capacities and  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 the business is surging at the rate of around 70% to 80% on volume terms. Even in MENA, we are seeing a huge growth happening in Oral Care. As far as competitive intensity in India is concerned, yes, from the competitor and the market leader, we've seen competitive intensity gone up, but we are matching up their prowess in trade and in visibility in the marketplace. Abneesh Roy: Understood. My second question is on the fruit juice and Campa Cola impact. You were the first company to really highlight the risk well before other companies. You said on the impact of Campa Cola in Q1. So I wanted to understand now Coca-Cola is also looking to cut prices from INR25 to INR20 in the 400 ml. So if you could talk about that, how does that impact your price architecture? Second is, if you could discuss on how much is the presence of Campa Cola in your market,? Because what we understand is that it is still in few markets. So if it is in a few markets, how come the impact is there on pan-India business for you? Mohit Malhotra: Yes. So as far as beverage is concerned, firstly, the season did not favor us. I think without the season, which is more monsoon and flood led. Secondly there was high competitive intensity. What has happened is that, it didn’t directly impact our business, but the pack price architecture and the pricing index has actually become worse. So for us, the 1-litre pack happens to be INR130. And for Colas, the 1-liter pack happens to be around INR50. So the price index has gone up to 2.7 from something around 2.1. So going forward, we'll be increasing our value proposition to the consumers by introducing INR100 price points in the 1-litre category. This is on the 1 litre. As far as out-of-home consumption is concerned, which is INR10 price point, Campa Cola is at INR10 now. And even the big players like Varun and HCCB are also looking to cut the prices and will be available at INR15 price point. We have a Tetra Pak, which is available at INR20. So we've introduced INR10 bottle. We've introduced INR20 bottle. We've introduced INR65 bottle and also now 1 litre. is also available, and 2 litre. will also be available. So we are trying to plug all price points with juice-based drinks across. As far as the impact is concerned, I cannot directly correlate the impact, but we can feel a little bit of shift in this coming season from juice-based beverages to fizz-based drinks. Firstly, the summer was a little bit acute and therefore, people preferred refreshment-based drinks rather than health based. But I think that was more momentary and transitory because of the price. So there is an impact, but it's an indirect impact of carbonated drinks on the juices. Abneesh Roy: Mohit, two quick follow-ups here. One, in terms of the shift from the juice towards the fizz, would that be structural in nature? I know you are taking multiple steps to overcome it. One is if you could comment on margins, how it impacts because if you are becoming more sharper in terms of pricing, provided nothing changes, say, in raw material. What happens on margins? Second, the awareness quotient clearly is increasing for customers. So the perception is though its fruit juice, but it is sweet. And the fruit content, obviously, people can easily read on the pack. And you also said that in the fizzy drink clearly, because it is so hot and so warm, there is a requirement.  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 So even if that is also sweet and maybe the non-sugar-wise anyway, that issue is not there. So I'm asking, is this a structural issue of more focus on health, so awareness is there. So do you need much more in terms of the R&D aspect to overcome it rather than just pricing? And what happens on the margins given the sharper pricing, which you have taken? Mohit Malhotra: As far as margins are concerned, the margins in the total juice portfolio have actually moved up. And that has happened because of the premiumisation at one end and also introducing the price points, which are more value offering to consumers on the other end. So both are kind of going hand-in-hand for us. So we've introduced coconut water also, so which are margin accretive to us. We've introduced value-added juices also, which are accretive to us, etc. So that is like kind of balancing our margin. And overall, our margins have actually moved up. As far as our representation in drinks, fizz and carbonated is concerned, we are also pivoting ourselves to have representation in carbonated and in drinks. So that has given us good benefit. As you know, we've got a INR200 crores business, which is a drinks portfolio and our fizz-based business, fruit-based fizz drinks for us has also done very well. We've also introduced cans in Jammu, test marketed it and this has also done exceedingly well in the marketplace. So I think, A) pivoting the business towards refreshment besides health is there, B) Fruit plus fizz which is the second vector of growth. Coming to if there is a structural change? I don't think there is a structural change. If you look at overall big picture, a 50,000 ft -level view, you would find that the penetration of juices or fruit-based beverages in India is still 8% as compared to 25% in China. And that is the example that I can give you from our neighbouring markets. So I don't think there's a structural shift because the penetration of juices is still so low in the country and fruit is definitely considered more nourishing than only flavoured waters. So that's what my take would be. Abneesh Roy: Sir, last quick question. So this inventory correction you have done, I wanted to ask on that. So clearly, FMCG companies keep doing it. The issue was that the quantum was extremely high. And we have not seen any other consumer company even talking about it currently. So what is different about your business since you are also very diversified. I understand in juice business there was a clear 2 quarters of issue. But how come it impacts overall business and the quantum if you can discuss that? Second, you mentioned in the coming quarters, the growth will come back to normal. You also said that urban slowdown has bottomed out. Now other companies are not saying that. They are saying this is start and so we need to watch out. So what is your confidence of saying urban has bottomed out? Is it because you have taken the correction or it's more of a company-specific thing you are highlighting? Mohit Malhotra: So first, let me answer your second question first. I think as far as urban is concerned, why I say it has bottomed out is because if you look at the base effect, base quarter of urban was very high.  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 It's already gone down to around 2.8% kind of a growth in FMCG urban that we are seeing. I don't think so it's going to go beyond bottoming out from here. And if you really look at the intrinsic urban consumption, which is also driven by e-commerce, quick commerce, modern trade, etc, these channels are definitely showing a high growth, and they now contribute around 24% of the overall salience of our business. That is growing at a very high double digit, and that is 50% of the urban consumption as far as we are concerned. So that is showing no tell-tale signs of diminishing. So that is where I'm coming from. It's already bottomed out even in GT. So whether the consumption is happening through GT or through these emerging channels, something. So that's what my take would be that it has bottomed out. And as far as rural is concerned, rural remains resilient, and we see secondary growth in rural higher than urban by around 130 bps for us. But if I look at the Nielsen data, our growth in rural is 600 basis points higher as compared to urban. So rural remains resilient and urban, in my view, should start recovering with the festive season. And we've seen the kharif acreage is also high. So that augurs well for rural, and there has been MSP increases on the Rabi crop also, which should give more disposable income in the hands of the consumer. But food inflation is something which is worrying me, which is in the range of around 9% and which is shifting the monies from discretionary to more essential items. So that was the first part of your question. As far as the extent of inventory correction is concerned, now extent of inventory correction was high, yes. We were deciding to take this inventory correction. But when we press the pedal on the 25th till that time, our business was doing very well. Our HPC business till the 25th of September, HPC was growing at 9%; Health Care was growing at 8%; overall business was growing at 6% and beverage business was declining in secondary by 11%. So beverage business is the one which exacerbated the whole issue of inventory for us. And generally, beverage which is low shelf life product is high, as compared to HPC and HC businesses which have the 3-years of shelf life whereas beverage has only 6-month shelf life. It occupies a lot of space at the distributor end as well. So, the inventory piles up and the pressure is then felt on HC and HPC business because the entire ecosystem revolves around targets. So people have to do their numbers. So if one vertical doesn't fire, they try to push in the other vertical and therefore, inventory piles up. So when we took correction, the correction happened across the board for the entire portfolio, but more so in the beverage business. That's why optically the quantum is looking high for you. Mihir Shah from Nomura Mihir Shah: So I wanted to check, would it be fair to assume that the GT inventory correction is now behind completely and 3Q will be a normal growth quarter? And what according to you is normal growth in volume and value terms in the second half? So that's my first question. Mohit Malhotra: Yes. So I think inventory correction is behind us. Whatever inventory correction we had to do, we quickly did it in 1 month only rather than prolonging this pain for a long time. It's like a  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 disease is better to cure and correct it in one go. That we have done. So we've done corrections, but for health care business, which was preseason, and therefore, we loaded Chyawanprash, so that is not compromised at all. In second half, we expect to grow back in mid- to high single- digits.. This is subject to good winters and FMCG also doing well. We will continue to grow ahead of the category and gain market share. So on the the overall strategy and big picture, I think matrices are fine. Our market shares are going up, household penetrations are moving up our distribution is expanding. This is one-off correction, spring cleaning that we have done, and that too only on behest of our distributors, so that our ROI of the distributors improves. And that's the feedback that we got. So very strong fundamentals of the business, which do not change at all. Mihir Shah: Got it. I see the market shares are going up and maybe the inflationary environment is also kind of helping that from the unorganized players. But is it fair to assume that given Dabur's rural saliency and winter saliency is high and La Nina here, you should be geared to be a key beneficiary, and grow ahead of the markets and peers? I just wanted to get a confirmation on that. Mohit Malhotra: Yes, absolutely. I have no doubts about it. I think we should be going ahead of the market with La Nina here. I hope the winter is strong, more severe and more protracted so that Chyawanprash business does well for us. We also have plans to recover our beverage business, which is a little pain point at the moment. Mihir Shah: Understood. Secondly, Mohit, if you can just deep dive a little bit on the hair care portfolio, the hair oils, particularly. If you can give any qualification or quantification on how your Dabur Amla has done? And how do you see that portfolio shaping up? Mohit Malhotra: Yes. So in hair oils, we are market leaders in the perfume category. As you know, we've got representation in perfumed oils where we have Dabur Amla and Dabur Amla has got this ring- fenced by the flanker brands, which is Sarson Amla, Badam Amla, etc. So the ring-fence brands promise economy to the consumer and therefore unbranded shift to those branded oils. Dabur Amla is our cash cow and that we are protecting from competitor, which is half the price here. And therefore, the flanker brands come in. We've done well in hair oils and perfumed hair oils, wherein we've gained around 120 bps in perfumed hair oil. So there is Amla, there's Sarson Amla, then there is almond oil where also we have gained market shares from a single largest player in the market. Plus, we launched cooling oils in the market, Cool King. Cool King this year will be around INR25 crores, and it's actually doing very well and the reception from the market is fantastic. So what we are doing is that we have a right to win in hair oils, and we are trying to plug. We are trying to have representations in different subsegments of hair oils. So Cool King, we plugged organically. And with Sesa coming in, we'll be plugging the Ayurvedic segment. On hair oils, we make a gross margin of around 44%. With Sesa coming in, it comes at around 57% gross margins. And those gross margins are coming without the scale of procurement of Sesa Private Care as a company. With the scale of  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 Dabur, we feel that we'll be able to take up the gross margins even further. If you look at the price points in the market, if Amla is at INR0.45 per mL, this is at INR1.7 per ml. And so is Kesh King at INR1.7 per ml. Indulekha sits at around INR4.7 per ml.. So getting the leverage from our scale of procurement, I think this gross margins of 57% is also under-pitched. So this is plugging our premiumization strategy. This is plugging our white space strategy and solidifying and consolidating our core business of hair oils. Plus it also has opportunity in international business, which contributes to 25% of our hair oils. For Sesa brand, international business is only 11%. So that will critically go up to around 25%. But I think that's huge. Like if we do around INR1,600 crores in India, we do overall around INR2,000 crores portfolio of hair oils we have in the overall kitty and Sesa will only add on to that. Yes. Coconut oils, which is another subsegment for us, grew by around 14%, and we've gained market share. The market leader took price increases in coconut oil due to the inflation and so did we. The gross margins also inched up there in the coconut oils. So Sesa can play in two categories for us. One is coconut-based ayurvedic oils. Other is perfume-based ayurvedic oils. So we would want to compete in both the subcategories wherever the consumer need is, somewhere the consumer need is pre-bath, somewhere the consumer need is post bath. Different markets have different consumer behaviours, and we would want to plug that gap here. So overall, in both the subsegments of coconut and perfume, we've gained market shares. So, on back of market shares, we feel the growth in this category for us will be higher as compared to the market growth rate. So this acquisition should not be seen from point of view of that the hair oil category. It's a low- growth category. It's been stagnant for the past 3-4 years, and therefore, why this acquisition. The real rationale for acquisition is we are a INR2,000 crores business, and we want to solidify this business as it's a core business, we have market shares of 16%, and we have huge headroom for growth in terms of market share gain. That is the way we see it, and that's the lens with which we want you to have a look at this. Such distribution, if you look at Dabur's distribution is 45 lakh outlets where hair oil goes to, the Sesa brand only reaches out to around 6 to 6.5 lakhs thereabout. In terms of direct distribution also, they are available in 1.2 to 1.3 lakh outlets. We are available in around 3.5 to 4 lakh outlets. So, I think each of the places, we have miles to go. Plus the penetration of ayurvedic hair oils, which are therapeutic hair oils, is only around 6% to 7%. And if you look at the overall market, the instance of perception of a hair problem or a hair fall is 60% and the penetration is only 6% with a huge headroom to grow here. Plus, there is an extendibility of the brand. If you look at most of the market players like Indulekha and Kesh King, 20% of their business comes from shampoo business. And shampoo is a huge market, again with a high growth rate there of around 6% to 7%. 20% of the market is shampoo market, which is extended from ayurvedic. So this theoretically can  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 also be extended there. Around 8% of Sesa's business is coming from shampoo. That also has huge legs to grow and hair fall, shampoo can be a very big opportunity. Mihir Shah: Mohit. Great to know it is quite ring-fenced and seems to be like a good acquisition. My last question is actually on the health supplement business. You did mention Chyawanprash grew by 12%, and that was a bit of a relief as well. Do you expect this continue? Because if you see over the past 3 years, on an absolute basis, the Chyawanprash or health supplement absolute numbers has stagnated. Do you expect growth to finally pick up in the second half in the winter in the health supplements business? And which ones did not do well, which led to overall growth to be lower at 2% for health supplements in Q2 if Chyawanprash grew by 12%? Mohit Malhotra: Yes. So there is a no stop strategy here. So we are having no hold on to anything, whether it's advertising or it's activation or it's trade lubrication. I think we are working on all levers to ensure that Chyawanprash comes back on track and back on the growth path. And hopefully, with La Nina, I think Chyawanprash should continue to grow. We've done the loading in the marketplace. Now we are looking at secondaries to actually pick up in Chyawanprash. We have introduced a format called Khajurprash, which is basically meant for women and handles the iron deficiency in women also. Its a very tasty variant as well. I will nudge you all to have it. If we are able to send across the sample to the investor community, we will definitely do the same. So, we've done innovation. We've also introduced small pack of Chyawanprash for trials to be generated at around INR65 pack for increasing the penetration. In Q2, we did a monsoon campaign to promote Chyawanprash's all-weather consumption. Chyawanprash has a perception that it's good only in winters. So, to kind of demystify that Chyawanprash is an all-weather friend for building immunity, we did the monsoon campaign and monsoon campaign gave us great dividends in terms of this 12% growth that you see. So yes, we're keeping our fingers crossed that Avi Mehta from Macquarie Avi Mehta: Just first bit was on the margin side. With inventory correction largely driving almost 100 basis points contraction in reported margins at the operating level and a move towards giving higher value, could you help us understand how should we look at FY '25 margins? Ankush Jain: Yes. I think widely at an H1 level, it is almost 100 bps correction. And now at least with some top line improvement foreseen in H2 with hopefully good winters and if the top line happens to the level of mid- to high single digits, then I think we should be able to leverage cost and protect margins for H2, So almost flattish margins at this level in H2. That will be our intent at least. Avi Mehta: Fairly clear, fairly clear on that. And the second bit is on the Sesa acquisition. Now while I understand the strategic rationale, could you help me understand the EPS impact over the next few years? Because it seems at least on year 1, there is dilution, but you did point towards synergies. Could you give us a sense on what are the synergies quantum that you're looking over here?  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 Ankush Jain: I think what will happen is, the process will go into some bit of merger and regulatory approval. It will take at least 1.5 to 2 years. The next 1.5 years, there will be no impact on Dabur EPS to start with. Post that, we feel that once most of the synergies start coming in, the operating margin should inch up to 18% to 19%, which is similar to Dabur once the complete synergies get in. Avi Mehta: Okay. Perfectly clear. And sorry, with your permission just a clarification. The mid- to high single-digit growth comment in the second half is on volume basis and the pricing growth of 2% odd expectation should sustain. That is correct, right? Mohit Malhotra: Yes. We have a price increase of around 1.5% that we've done in H1, but the price increase impact got diluted by the trade and the extra value that we give on the top line. So that has kind of got nullified. So, it's a mid- to high single-digit kind of a growth rate that we are looking. It all depends upon how the market kind of behaves and grows. To the previous question, Avi, want to mention that Sesa business is really gross margin accretive, operating margin accretive and will provide leverage on all the cost heads to our hair oil portfolio, which is today giving me an operating margin of low double digit, which will end up giving me a high double-digit operating margin. So it will be a positive leverage on the operating margin for us. Avi Mehta: Okay, that's very clear, Mohit. Perfect. Thanks a lot for this and wish you all a very happy festive season. Thank you very much. Harit Kapoor from Investec Harit Kapoor: I just had two questions. One is on the improving the ROI for the distributor part. So there are other ways as well in terms of credit periods etc, or probably at a numerator level, even taking the margin. Just wanted to know, have any of those other pieces also been moved or it's only been reducing the inventory pipeline? And if it's only inventory days reduction at the distributor level, what's the quantum of that? And is it fair to assume that since you started this on 25th September, it was 6 days reduction? Mohit Malhotra: So the ROI of distributor will be improved on back of the number of days of inventory that he's carrying. He was carrying inventory of 30 days. And as we speak after the correction, it will be around 21 days of inventory. So, ROI substantially improves for him. The turnover remaining the same and the inventory correction will reduce the amount of investment that he has in the business. And therefore, there will be an improvement in the ROI. That is what I think the question was. I hope I've been able to answer. Harit Kapoor: Yes. Just the question was really apart from this 9-day reduction, has there anything else been done, whether it's credit periods or overall percentage margin, etc? Mohit Malhotra: Yes. For the past couple of months, we've been giving a little extra credit to the distributors also. So that has also gone up. Because the inventory was high, there was inability on part of the distributor to extend that extra credit in the marketplace also because he watches his ROI etc. So  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 I think that trade extensions will also go down, which we were offering earlier. The number three lever is that a lot of stockists used to have stockist salesmen on their payroll. We shifted them from their payroll to a third-party payroll, which is a team lease payroll, and some part of the margin was given back to them to improve their ROI also. So all that is also happening alongside. Plus this phenomena of ROI reduction is more in urban India rather than rural India. So in urban, we are also providing some sort of subsidy to our distributors to ensure their ROIs come in. As far as rural is concerned, there's not too much of pain because the cost of doing business is much lower in rural as compared to urban. And urban also the shoe is pinching of the distributors because of the quick commerce and the e-commerce surge, which is happening. And some part is the price conflict, and some part is also offtake from the retail outlets in urban India going down and therefore, the inventory piling up, which will get corrected as we have reduced the inventory. And going forward, we are also looking at a way to do some sort of consolidation of distributors in urban India and not so much in rural. In rural, we will look at expansion of distribution, get into more number of villages and small towns and expand our distribution, divide our distribution into HPC, HC and foods and for urban looking at more consolidation. Harit Kapoor: Got it. But any of these incremental initiatives over the next 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, in your view, should not have a material impact on the business from a disruption standpoint? Mohit Malhotra: No, I don't think there's any disruption in business. No, not at all. I don't think so. This was one- off. And this one-off also we've done in almost 20 years. Dabur has never done it. And this is like a spring cleaning of the house, which was warranted once in a decade at least. So yes, maybe after a decade or so, you might expect it, I might not be there. So I don't think we foresee this happening again. Harit Kapoor: Sure, sure. I'm not so sure if I'll be on a call after a decade as well, so. The second thing was on Sesa. So you've very clearly mapped out the rationale. I just wanted to get your sense on how are you thinking of kind of category growth because certain interactions that we have for the top two players in this space also suggest that their growths have not been so flattering. So I'm sure you've kind of seen that when you evaluated this. I also see basis your numbers that there was a slightly lower rate of growth last year for this entity. So that's my first question on Sesa. And the second one really is on the geographic mix, which part of the market does it have a higher salience? Mohit Malhotra: Yes. So as far as Sesa is concerned, I told you there are a couple of levers that make us so confident that we will continue to grow and grow at a higher pace, higher growth than what our hair oils is actually growing. It's a national brand, unlike Badshah that we acquired, which is more of a Western brand, and their contribution is very complementary to us. Their contribution comes from Central, which is the mainstay of Dabur, which is UP, Bihar, etc, at 30% contribution.  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 West, which is low for Dabur, they are high, which is 27% contribution coming from there. They are over-skewed on chemist channel and less skewed on grocery channel where Dabur is high skewed on grocery and less skewed on chemist. So that provides opportunity as far as we are concerned. North for them is 11%, for Dabur is skewed at around 25%, which is double. There, there is upside from our distribution is concerned. East, they are around 20% contribution and for Dabur is about the same. And South, they are higher skewed, 11% contribution in South and Dabur hair oil has low contribution coming from South and ayurvedic hair oils tend to be more salient in South. In Bangladesh, where Dabur is low, they have a higher presence. They are market leaders with 90% market share in the ayurvedic segment in Bangladesh. So they will help, and it's a coconut market. So there, they help us to premiumize our entire portfolio in Bangladesh. Middle East, which is a huge 25% contributor to our overall global hair oil business, they are not present in Middle East. So that entire place is up for taking. We have the RTM and the GTM established in around 20 countries in Middle East, where they have zero presence whatsoever. So that's the upside that we have. In terms of sheer numbers, we have a direct reach of around 3 lakh to 4 lakh outlets. They have a direct reach of 1.2 lakh. So this direct reach immediately in our control. The moment we bolt on the distribution to our distribution. And the indirect distribution is around 6 lakhs as compared to us being around 45 lakhs. And this category will have to be advertised, and the high gross margins allow that kind of advertising to be done there. They've got 300-odd distributors. We have got around 3,000 distributors. So their presence in rural is low. Our presence in rural with sub-stockist and Yodha network is extremely high. So I think all these are very synergistic sort of opportunities, which we saw. And it's a premium hair oil and the extension possibilities are many, can be extended into shampoo, into serums, etc. And hair care, I told you an instance of 60% of problem solution, and they solve the problem solution space in the benefit segmentation in the consumer's mind. So all these things work in our favor. Did I miss out any point of your question? I don't know. Harit Kapoor: No, fair point. If I have anything, I'll come back. Prakash Kapadia from Spark PMS Prakash Kapadia: Two questions from my end. Mohit, you alluded to food inflation being a big concern in urban demand. So any sense you could give us on down trading by consumers? Is LUP increasing? And you obviously mentioned you feel that from here on, growth should come back. So what's the outlook on urban demand coming back? That's the first question. And secondly, earlier for us and for most of the players in the FMCG business, GT was the real moat, direct and indirect partially, then came modern trade and then e-commerce and now it's quick commerce. So what does the future lie in terms of distribution and sustainable moat for us and your thoughts? Mohit Malhotra: Right. So I'll answer your first question, Prakash. So as far as urban is concerned, why I'm saying is urban has bottomed out because urban at the same time last year was growing at 11%. Now  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 it's come down to 2.8%. I don't think urban demand will go down. The last urban demand went down was during the COVID time to around minus 2%, 3%. And that was under the COVID time. After that, I think 2.8% is the most bottom kind of demand that I've seen. And if you look at sequentially, I think the volumes in urban have grown sequentially from 2.1% in Quarter 1 is now to 2.8%. If you look at the same period last year in quarter 3, the urban demand was 7.7%; from 7.7% on that base, I think it will be somewhere in the range of around 3%, 3.5%. And so I think rural and urban both will inch up like they've inched up. So it's a base effect also, which is kind of kicking in here, and we see urban demand picking up from here. And so the rural resilience is going to be picking up. Now coming to food inflation, food inflation is definitely high. If you look at all the subsegments of FMCG growth, we find food is the one which is growing on back of value, on back of price increases, whether it's food, non-staples, or food staples. The rest, Home Care, OTC, and Personal Care by far have remained flat. So I think with urban bottoming out, I see some amount of growth coming in even in the discretionary categories also. And as I told you, the acreage is higher, MSPs have gone up, so hopefully, food inflation should also tame going forward. And government has also called out on the food inflation. So there will be steps that the government will also take to tame the food inflation. The second part is modern trade, e-commerce, and quick commerce. I think one fundamental thing which is happening in India is that GT as a percentage salient will go down and e- commerce driven by quick commerce will only grow in the country. So what we are doing is that we are strengthening our relationship and bondages with e-commerce and quick commerce players and doing joint business planning with them, creating new products for them, connecting with them on a monthly, quarterly basis and seeing that we continuously grow shares in quick commerce and e-commerce portals, be it marketplaces like Amazon, Flipkart or be it quick commerce channel like Swiggy, Instamart, Blinkit and Zepto. Our growth there is higher than their FMCG growth. So if they have grown by 50%, we've grown by 70% with them on their verticals. So we are ensuring that we grow market shares, and we continuously launch innovations which are very customized to these customers. As far as modern trade is concerned, our visibility is still little muted in modern trade and therefore on back of investment in modern trade and on back of gaining market shares from other players, I think modern trade for us should also continuously grow. But the quick commerce players are putting pressure on modern trade also besides GT. So if you look at the results of DMart and Reliance Retail, they are also a little under pressure today because the quick commerce and e-commerce is actually putting pressure on them also, and they would also be pivoting on multi-ways of distribution, whether it's electronically or through offline, etc.  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 So going forward, this gradual change from GT to MT to e-commerce is something which will endure. I don't think this is a flash in the pan and will disappear. I think this is enduring here, and this change will come. And how fast, we will have to watch. But GT is a very integral part today and will continue to be integral part because rural is a huge part of India. So at one end, we would be wanting to consolidate in urban India and other end, we would want to extend our distribution in rural. So keep expanding rural with sub-stockist and Yodha channel which provide visibility to our business there so that assortment would go up, increase our direct reach in urban smaller cities, increase our direct reach in rural to have visibility and better assortment, reduce our reliance on wholesale and increase our direct reach. That is the fundamental strategy for rural and semi- urban markets. For metro markets, 8, 10 cities, I think, will keep expanding along with the quick commerce portals as they expand from 10 cities to 20 cities to maybe 100 cities going forward. Sorry for a long answer, but yes. Prakash Kapadia: No, that's helpful. So what essentially you are alluding to is work with them and try and be part of that and do customization and see what sells and how much we can participate in that growth to adapt to this, right? Mohit Malhotra: Absolutely. Yes. Prakash Kapadia: Fine. At least on the urban side. And rural still, I think the GT would continue to play a larger role. Mohit Malhotra: In terms of villages, we reach out to 1,20,000 villages. Headroom is to go up to 6 lakh villages in the country. So huge headroom there. And in direct reach also, overall, Dabur's direct plus indirect is 84 lakh outlets. We only go to something around 15 lakh outlets. So where is 15 lakh, and we should be minimum around 30% of 84 lakhs, so around 25 lakhs, and we are only in around 15 lakhs. So we can double our direct reach also. Percy Panthaki from IIFL Securities Percy Panthaki: I just wanted to know after this pipeline correction, what is the distributor days now? Mohit Malhotra: Around 21 days, and we want to bring it down to around 19 days by end of December. Ankush Jain: And maybe just to add on even with 21 days, it's slightly on the higher side because we have loaded bit of Chyawanprash to take care of season. Percy Panthaki: Okay. So even in Q3, basically, the primary will be lower than secondary by 2% approximately? Mohit Malhotra: No, no. Percy Panthaki: So then how will 21 come down to 19 then Mohit? Ankush Jain: These inventory days are based on forward cover. Hence, even in December end, we expect it to bring it to 19 to 20 days, maybe around 20 days.  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 Percy Panthaki: Okay. On beverages, I just wanted to understand where the largest impact is. So you have the fruit drinks portfolio, then you have the nectars and then you have the juices. So where is the impact the most? I would assume it is in the fruit drinks, but just correct me if I'm wrong there. And secondly, the drinks that we had ventured into in a material way some 3 or 4 years ago, I believe in the first year, we had crossed INR100 crores, etc. So versus what was the peak turnover that we did in juices? And versus that, what is the sort of number that we are likely to do in FY '25? Mohit Malhotra: Okay. Let me answer this question. Our complete beverage portfolio is divided into 4 parts. Now first part is coconut water. Our coconut water, we were struck by Storia last year, who came out with a PET bottle. So just to tell you, it's a good news that we've bounced back by giving a lot of value in coconut water and the market shares have gone up by 200 basis points. The overall Activ Coconut portfolio has increased by 16% in terms of secondary. So that's one part of the portfolio. The active 100% juices for us has not got impacted by the season. I think this is premium portfolio for us, which is 7.3% growth, which quarter to August was also growing by around 18%, 19% for us, and it's the most margin-accretive portfolio. So that is the second part of the portfolio. The third part of the portfolio is a drinks portfolio. which registered a turnover of around INR200 crores. In the current year, we've got a growth of around 16% in this portfolio. But the 16% growth is excluding East, where we were the hardest hit because of the Northeast. Our per capita consumption of juices is the highest in Northeast in India, highest. And Northeast was reeling under floods in the quarter 2, and that was a wettest monsoon that we could see in the Northeast, and that was hit. Minus Northeast, our growth was 16%, 17%. Northeast impacted and the growth became negative to around 8%. But drinks is not what has got impacted so much. The real impact which has happened in the Nectar business. Our Nectar business has declined by minus 12%. So drinks, Activ Coconut and Real Fizz which is the carbonated portfolio. Carbonated portfolio grown by 100% for us. So therefore, there's a tailwind towards carbonate, albeit very small for us, but around 70%, 80% of the portfolio is Real Nectar, which is where we got impacted the most, which declined by around 12%. Percy Panthaki: And that decline is basically customers' preferences towards more cheaper alternatives? Or is there anything else towards that decline? Mohit Malhotra: I think the entire category declined by around 8.6% in terms of volume. We gained a market share of 230 bps. So, if you compare to relative performance vis-a-vis Tropicana or Slice or B- Natural, Real is surely a preferred choice among the consumer in the juices and nectars' market. So market shares have gone up. So it's a very good sign. So in Nielsen data, we've grown higher than the category. That's one. But category itself is declining. So I think Tetra pack is moving to bottles. The consumer preference is they want to see what they are having. So in Tetra pack, we've launched a 1-litre bottle. We have launched a 2-litre bottle. We've launched a 500 mL bottle and there is a 200 mL bottle also at all price points of  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 INR10, INR20, INR100. That is the price point that we have plugged with nectars as well. So that should take care of the problem. Percy Panthaki: Is the problem in Nectar is that the average price per litre. or per 100 or 200 mL, whatever you count it, that is much more expensive versus some of the cheaper options like colas, etc, as you called out that Campa is sort of giving a lot more value, although it's not a comparable product, but it's like an imperfect substitute. And therefore, people are saying that this is not something that is affordable in light of the other options available in the market, and that's why this category is declining. Is that understanding, correct? Mohit Malhotra: Yes, that is a correct understanding. There is a price difference because Campa for 1 litre., which is a party pack and in-home consumption is available at a INR45 –and forget Campa, even Pepsi or Coke is available at around INR50 for a 1-litre price point. And as compared to Real, which is 70% market share player, it's available at INR130. So there is a definite difference between the 2 things, yes. Percy Panthaki: But Mohit, if this is the reason, then what is the solution? Because then we don't see an end in sight, and this can keep declining for many more quarters. So is there an end in sight? And is there a solution if this is the root cause? Mohit Malhotra: So therefore, the solution to this is we have pivoted into drinks. Drinks are pegged at a similar price point as soft drinks. That's exactly what I explained to you, INR10, INR20, INR50 and INR100 price point, drink is pegged at par with the carbonated and fruit-based fizz drinks are also at par. That said, it is a small base. So therefore, it cannot compensate for the 80% of the Nectar business. We have to provide value in the Nectar business also. Therefore, we are introducing a INR100 tropical juices in nectars. And also, we are planning to give a value on Nectar by giving a tangible goody there. So that is what we are trying to do. But I think it's a matter of time before the pricing will get normalized and this cola war should end, and we have been a little collateral damage in this cola war for past 6 months or so. But I don't think that is the only problem. I think it's more monsoon and season, which created havoc for beverage. Percy Panthaki: Got it, Mohit. That's all from me. Thanks and all the best. Kunal Vora from BNP Paribas Kunal Vora: First question on Namaste litigation, how much did you spend in first half? And what's the status now? How much longer do you expect to continue spending on it? Ankush Jain: Yes. So in fact, in first half, we have spent around INR40 crores to INR45 crores, and we expect around INR85 crores to INR90 crores in full year. Last year, it was INR110-odd crores on a yearly basis. So there is a reduction in cost because there has been some optimization, not only in terms of lawyers, but also in terms of their management and more optimization of the lawyers. Mohit Malhotra: So therefore, we've got a INR20-30 crores of saving from last year's base on the litigation cost on Namaste. That said, this is all a provision that we are keeping in our books. As the insurance  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 company gives us a guarantee to pay, this part of this provision can be reversed depending upon the case that we are fighting. Kunal Vora: Understood. And is there a visibility on when does this end? Ankush Jain: We think around 1.5 years from now is the best estimate which we have got from various lawyers interaction. But knowing U.S., it can do plus/minus 6 months or thereabouts. Kunal Vora: Understood. Second is, how do you supply to quick commerce? How does it work? Are you supplying directly or through distributors? And how are the margins offered to quick commerce companies versus like overall portfolio? And as the distribution, which was like fragmented earlier through GT, now like there is a consolidation happening with modern trade and e- commerce, especially in cities. Is there a risk which you see to the margins? Mohit Malhotra: Yes. So we guys used to supply to quick commerce and modern trade through our GT stockist. But I think around 1.5 years back, we've started direct supplies to the quick commerce players. Let's take an example of Blinkit, so we supply from our side to the Blinkit warehouses. There are roughly around 20 to 30 warehouses they have. From those 20 warehouses, they supply to 500 to 600 dark stores. From the dark stores, it goes to the consumer. So that's the supply chain which is there, from us to the quick commerce players, all of them, whether it's Zepto or a Blinkit or it is Swiggy. As far as margins are concerned, our margins are around 100 to 200 basis points higher in quick commerce as compared to e-commerce marketplaces. And moreover, compared to GT also, our margins are higher because we sell larger packs to them and TOTs are better as compared to modern trade. Kunal Vora: Understood. But how do you see this consolidation happening on the other side, modern trade, e-commerce, they become larger, they will have like higher bargaining power. Do you think this can be a longer-term risk to the margin? Mohit Malhotra: Yes, we used to think that there could be a consolidation. But knowing India, I think question of consolidation doesn't arise. Now everybody is pivoting towards being a quick commerce player. So if you look at big basket is also a quick commerce, and Amazon is also wanting to become a big quick commerce. Tata is becoming a quick commerce. You heard the news today. So I think one after the other, there will be many players. Flipkart has introduced ‘Minutes’ as a quick commerce player. So therefore, there will be multiple quick commerce players and the bargaining power shifting in their hands is very difficult when there are many players. So I think it will remain in our hands only, and there are so many manufacturers. So as the market democratizes and more and more quick commerce players come in, I think because of the competitive intensity, margins will be where they are. So I don't think margins will go up. Kunal Vora: How are the distributors reacting to you supplying directly to various large players like quick commerce and modern trade versus through distributors earlier?  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 Mohit Malhotra: As far as distributor is concerned, there is a distributor consortium of All India Consumer Product Distributors Federation. They are up in arms against all these quick and e-comm players, and they have made representations to the Commerce Ministry against the predatory pricing because so many of these quick commerce players are private equity funded and they subsidize products, come out with events like Big Billion Day etc and they deep discount the products which become loss leaders and hence attract footfalls for them. And then that disrupts the GT market. And as far as the general trade is concerned, they are also the vote bank of the government. So government can't afford not to appease them. And that's why you've heard so many articles of government against the predatory pricing of these quick commerce players. So I think it's a larger question there. So obviously, stockists have not taken it in good taste of what's happening on quick commerce. But you can't help it. So you have to bypass the stockist and go to them because their terms of trade and their want of products is such which only company themselves can fulfil. Dark store keeps an inventory of 3 days, not more than 3 days, which distributors can't fill in, which only a company EDI Direct connect with the Blinkit EDI can fulfil on a replenishment basis in their warehouse. It's not possible for them to supply the entire assortment, which may be required by quick commerce players. Kunal Vora: Understood, very helpful. Thank you, that was from my side. Shirish Pardeshi from Centrum Stock Broking Shirish Pardeshi: It was a bit excited to not get into the much deeper on the inventory and other thing. But you mentioned in the opening slide, quick commerce growing at a rapid pace. And you just mentioned that the dark store inventory is sub minimal at 3, 4 days. So rather than looking at the front end and the distributor connect, do we need to have a breakthrough innovation in the supply chain at the back end so that the distributor inventory correction issue will not come in future? Mohit Malhotra: So I think the back end is supply chain. So on supply chain, we are actually trying to do an experiment with the Blinkit etc, to have a direct connect with them, connecting our internal supply chain of our warehouse to their dark store, but seems very difficult because they keep a very low inventory, and they don't have a backup there. And as far as distributors are concerned, we are trying a model, something like where an app can be given to a distributor or retailer so that direct orders can be sent to us and the delivery and the cash management can happen from the distributor. So we are trying and experimenting multiple models on digital to see how to navigate this problem. But the short-term solve for us was inventory correction and also moving the salesmen on a third-party payroll and refunding and a little bit of subsidy to be given to them to improve their profitability. I don't know if I answered your question correctly. Shirish Pardeshi: Yes. So, having spent time in FMCG at the front end, I was more curious because have you done any studies, say, for example, Bombay, Delhi or for example, Bombay, if we would have been doing on an average, about INR25 crores, INR30 crores on a month basis. And there is a quick  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 commerce, e-commerce, and modern trade, which is flourishing. Is there an actual demand which has been getting crushed because I still don't understand people are pointing out the urban demand is coming down. Is there any study or is there any depth you can give me? Mohit Malhotra: So as far as urban demand is concerned, I don't think urban demand is really coming down. Overall, FMCG urban is under pressure because of food inflation that is understood. But this urban demand is getting catered through e-commerce and quick commerce because the consumer behaviour is changing to wanting to shop digitally and online and not go to a nearby Kirana Store. And what Nielsen does is, which is a syndicated data that the entire industry refers to looking at the consumer demand in urban, they generally track the GT and the pop and mom stores and not so much the quick commerce or the e-commerce players. They track MT and they track GT. So a lot of demand, which is there on e-commerce and quick commerce is perhaps not getting captured by the data which is there in urban today. So that is also an issue. Ankush Jain: Yes. Maybe just to add on, while there's no study on this, but the impulsive purchase because of quick commerce probably the demand is actually getting generated, but it's not getting captured. That may be a hypothesis. Shirish Pardeshi: No, I'm more curious, sorry, I'm hopping on this. Though we have a product portfolio, maybe because of that, we need to keep our inventory at the higher level. But then if I look back, there are so much variation. Certain companies, I don't want to name, they keep an inventory of maybe about 5, 6 days, and there are certain companies who keep the inventory more than a month. So that's what my question was, that at the back-end innovation because we have digital and AI, which is coming up, so what is the issue to reinvent? Anyway, I'll take it offline. My second question is on the skin care and the health care portfolio, in healthcare specifically OTC and Ethical, we are doing better. But in this quarter, the growth rate, which was mentioned in the presentation, is flat. So is there a sharper inventory correction, and has it been done consciously?, Is the inventory under control now or we will have further impact on this? Mohit Malhotra: Okay. Skin care, as far as skin care is concerned, I think the real growth will happen in winter. Skin care consumption for us is more winter skewed. So I think we have a winter portfolio, and we expect skin care to actually pick up. As far as market shares are concerned, we've gained market shares in Fem also, which is more bleaches. So overall, I think skin care is doing okay. The secondaries being down in skin care, I think, was more of a collateral damage because of the inventory correction that we've done. It's a small percentage of our portfolio. And therefore, secondary may have suffered because of that. As far as Health Care is concerned, I think all verticals of Health Care continue to do well for us. So I told you Chyawanprash is 12% growth. Even in honey we gained market share, a little bit of crystallization problem is behind us. Glucose wasn't salient. Our Baby Care portfolio grew by around 30%.. Our Lal Tail continued to grow. Shilajit had a very high double-digit growth. Hajmola did well under the digestive portfolio.  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 So I think OTC, digestives, all portfolios did well for us. Now I think if you're talking about Honitus, which would have declined a little bit, I think that is on account of the high bases that we have in Honitus. That's why decline was there in Honitus. Otherwise, I think all verticals of health care did reasonably well. Shirish Pardeshi: Okay. My last question on the international business, though we have done a very good job there. But is there any further room in terms of margin improvement? Because last time when we had a physical meeting, we were banking on the international business will show some good profitability path. Mohit Malhotra: Yes. So international business is doing well. And I think one good thing on the margins is that our Middle East, North Africa, which is the most margin-accretive geography in the entire region is doing well. And we have a lot of innovations, as I was telling you, that Oral Care is something that we are doubling down, and Oral Care profitability is also pretty high in international business, that we are doubling down in. Dabur Red is one of the high-priced toothpastes. So I think on back of that, we will expect the margin improvement to happen. So, currency depreciation is something which arises in international. But as we lap over the currencies, now it's been happening over a year. And if you look at the first half also, we are down by INR181 crores on the currency depreciation. And this currency depreciation is a translation loss. There is also a transaction loss that happens because a lot of the products in international are imported by us, and they have to pay a dollar currency for the import of that, especially in Turkey market. So therefore, as we lap over the currencies, I think our margins will only improve in Egypt and in Turkey, which are very high salient markets for us. Shirish Pardeshi: Okay thank you Mohit and Ankush happy Diwali to you. Vishal Punmiya from Yes Securities Vishal Punmiya: Just one question from my side. So historically, we have been a key participator in the Maha Kumbh Melas. What are your plans for this year? And if you can also talk about the benefits as well as the cost that go behind this event? Mohit Malhotra: Yes. So I think for us, we are a rural salient company. 50% of the business comes from rural. And in rural, activations is a very big avenue to touch, feel and experience the product by the consumer. And we are very aggressive in terms of taking hoardings and doing experiential marketing. Last time when Kumbh was there, we did a special RTP campaign in Kumbh and had RTP taps that consumer could come to and take a toothbrush and take RTP on that and use it. And the more they try, the more conviction they build in the product and the more they buy. So this year also, we'll be participating in Maha Kumbh. And we also participated in other melas like Pandharpur Mela, Nauchandi Mela etc., which is a very huge congregation of consumers, to provide them experience with our product. Now we have Cool King, so we do special chumpies in these melas also, do auto branding, van branding, retail branding, stall branding etc. Vishal Punmiya: Sir, is there any major benefit that comes in? Or is it more lag in terms of demand improvement from all these events?  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 Mohit Malhotra: So it's a demand improvement that we get and which results in a better offtake and also sampling. So the more people sample, the more sampling happens, the more cascade effective trials and therefore, repeat purchase and market share moves up. So it's very tangible actually. Vishal Punmiya: Understood. Just quickly on the high interest cost and other income for the quarter, quickly you can comment on that? That was from my side. Ankush Jain: Yes. So first of all, you see other income and interest cost jointly. And if you see it jointly, it is almost 18%. In India, it grew by 7%, but in international, it grew by almost 18% or thereabouts. And this is primarily because in international geographies, we had some benefit, especially in Dubai, where some of the yields almost got doubled in certain international markets because of inflation and therefore, the interest rates going up. So that was the main reason for other income net increasing by 18%. Vishal Punmiya: Thank you and happy Diwali to team. Isha Lamba: I would like to thank all the participants for joining today's call. The webcast recording and transcript will be available on our website. Thank you and wish you all a Very Happy Diwali.",

    "qa_session": ". i'll now hand over to mr. mohit. thank you. mohit malhotra: thank you, isha. good evening, ladies, and gentlemen. we welcome you to dabur india limited's conference call pertaining to results for the quarter ended 30th september 2024. this quarter, the sector faced challenges from heavy monsoons, floods, and high food inflation, which slowed down urban consumption, especially in the beverage category for us. however, rural continues to be resilient and has outpaced urban growth for last 3 quarters. we believe urban consumption has bottomed out and should see an improvement going forward. as new channels have been growing ahead of general trade, this has put some pressure on profitability of our gt channel partners. we recognize the challenging times faced by our gt channel partners who are integral to dabur and have significantly contributed to building our esteemed business. as part of our commitment to good governance and in solidarity with them, we have undertaken one-time strategic initiative to rationalize inventories and enhance their profitability. as a result, our consolidated revenue declined by 5.5%. while this one-off proactive measure resulted in a temporary dip in sales, this was necessary step to enhance the profitability of our gt distributors and ensure long-term health and hygiene of our business. our business fundamentals remain strong with all underlining key consumer metrices of market share, household penetration, secondary sales and compounded annual growth on a positive trajectory. our secondary sales during the quarter grew by 2.3% year-on-year with home and personal care growing at 6%, health care growing by 4%. in addition, we gained market share across 95% of our portfolio. the international business exhibited resilience and registered a strong growth of 13% in constant currency terms. within the domestic business, home and personal care secondary sales grew by around 6%. hair oils grew ahead of the category and gained 40 bps market share. we are market leaders in hair oils with representation in both coconut and perfumed hair oils. a key white space has been premium ayurvedic hair oil segment that we have been calling out for a long time. i'm happy to announce that dabur has entered into an agreement to merge sesa care private limited, which has a consolidated turnover of inr133 crores. this proposed merger brings to dabur the premium sesa brand with strong credentials around ayurveda that will complement our existing portfolio and strengthen our presence in the inr14,000 crores hair oil category. given dabur's extensive distribution network and category leadership, this transaction will bring in substantial revenue and cost synergies. sesa brand will also enable us to premiumize our hair  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 oil portfolio as it is gross margin accretive. international businesses contribute to 19% of overall sesa’s sales with sesa being number 1 ayurvedic therapeutic hair oil in bangladesh market. home care portfolio continued on a strong growth trajectory with 9% year-on-year secondary sales growth and market share gains of 220 bps in air fresheners and 510 bps in mosquito repellent cream category. we continue to premiumize and expand our product range in odonil with gel pockets, diffusers, and premium air fresheners. we have extended odomos brand into liquid vaporizer format, which is seeing an encouraging response from the market. we intend to scale up this during upcoming months. this initiative will enable the home care portfolio to grow in double digits going forward in the future, taking up the portfolio from inr700 crores to around inr1,000 crores in 2 to 3 years' timeframe. in oral care category, our flagship brand, dabur red recorded secondary sales of around 5%. we have a strong number 2 position in the category with 1 out of every 2 households using dabur oral care products. dabur red toothpaste has a number 1 position in states like orissa, andhra pradesh, and tamil nadu. i'm happy to inform you that dabur red has become india's first ayurvedic toothpaste to get accreditation and recognition from indian dental association, a consortium of allopathic dental practitioners. going forward, we will ramp up our engagement with dentist community to cover around 1 lakh dentists. our health care segment posted a secondary sales growth of 4%. to promote all-weather consumption of chyawanprash, we rolled out a special monsoon campaign during the quarter, which has resulted in secondary growth of 12.6% in chyawanprash. the brand gained 20 bps market share to reach 61%. the chyawanprash category penetration has improved by 10 lakh households from pre-covid levels. to drive premiumization, we recently launched the khajurprash variant, which was very well received by the consumers. digestives portfolio recorded a secondary growth of 6% year-on- year, led by good growth in hajmola and market share gains of 160 bps. dabur honey also grew ahead of the category and gained market share of 60 bps. health juices and shilajit recorded a year-on-year growth of 20% each and baby care portfolio grew by 30%. in foods category, the business performed well with 20.6% growth in secondary sales. badshah continued on a strong footing and grew by 15%, both primary and secondary terms, driven by 15% volume growth. food business, including badshah, will cross inr500 crores this year, as alluded earlier. we intend to continue to grow foods vertical aggressively going forward as well. due to aggressive monsoons leading to floods and landslides in some parts of the country, the juices and nectar category declined in high single digits. despite the slowdown, we grew ahead of the category and gained volume market shares of 240 bps. we have put in place a multipronged strategy of ramping up our drinks portfolio, improving affordability through pack price architecture, revenue growth management and drive premiumization in emerging channels and expanding the distribution footprint to put juices and nectars back on the growth trajectory.  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 coming to profitability, the consolidated gross margins expanded by 102 basis points. the company increased its investment in advertising and promotion and went up from 6.8% of net sales in quarter 2 to 7.4%. however, deleverage on account of decline in revenue impacted the operating profit, which declined by 16.4%. i am pleased to announce that our company's dow jones sustainability index score has reported 170% improvement from 30 to 81 in last 2 years, reflecting our unwavering commitment to sustainability and responsible governance. i would like to once again reassure you that the underlying business fundamentals remain strong and overall health of the business continues to be robust. with rural growth continuing to be resilient, urban slowdown expected to have bottomed out and riding on the strategic initiatives, we are confident of our performance in the upcoming quarters to be back on track. we remain dedicated to investing behind our brands, expanding our distribution reach, and building our back-end capabilities to continue to deliver superior value creation. with this, i conclude my address and open the floor to q&a. thank you. abneesh roy from nuvama abneesh roy: my first question is on toothpaste. so we have seen 3 results till now in that space. you have grown by 5% and the market leader has grown in double digits with around 8% volume growth. and the number 3 player has also seen high single-digit growth. so one, how do you see your growth versus the other 2 players? second, have you seen a sharp ramp-up in the competitive intensity in q2 and do you see this as a structural development or that was a one-off given the margin pressure which market leader saw? mohit malhotra: right. so abneesh, overall, oral care category is growing quite well. we have grown ahead of the category at around 5% value, and we've gained market shares also in dabur red. besides dabur red, even meswak has performed very well in the quarter. dabur herbal toothpaste for us has also been doing very well. lal dant manjan, which is our tooth powder brand, has also grown by 7% in terms of secondary. so all the vectors of oral care for us have done well in the market and market shares have gone well. i can't comment so much on the competitor. but as far as we are there, i think oral care is one of the very aggressive vectors, which we will keep pushing to drive our growth. on oral care, i would want to mention one thing that we are really seeing huge tailwinds on our product portfolio and international business. oral care will be one of the second vectors of our growth besides hair care in the international business. we have completely saturated our installed capacity in markets like egypt, mena etc. on oral care, and we are augmenting capacity there. so there is a real heavy tailwind towards herbal, natural and ayurvedic products in oral care. in many countries, in mena and in egypt, we have already become number 2 and number 3 brands placating large global competitors that we have there. as a matter of fact, in egypt, we've become the number 2 brand in oral care, and we are putting up special installed capacities and  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 the business is surging at the rate of around 70% to 80% on volume terms. even in mena, we are seeing a huge growth happening in oral care. as far as competitive intensity in india is concerned, yes, from the competitor and the market leader, we've seen competitive intensity gone up, but we are matching up their prowess in trade and in visibility in the marketplace. abneesh roy: understood. my second question is on the fruit juice and campa cola impact. you were the first company to really highlight the risk well before other companies. you said on the impact of campa cola in q1. so i wanted to understand now coca-cola is also looking to cut prices from inr25 to inr20 in the 400 ml. so if you could talk about that, how does that impact your price architecture? second is, if you could discuss on how much is the presence of campa cola in your market,? because what we understand is that it is still in few markets. so if it is in a few markets, how come the impact is there on pan-india business for you? mohit malhotra: yes. so as far as beverage is concerned, firstly, the season did not favor us. i think without the season, which is more monsoon and flood led. secondly there was high competitive intensity. what has happened is that, it didn’t directly impact our business, but the pack price architecture and the pricing index has actually become worse. so for us, the 1-litre pack happens to be inr130. and for colas, the 1-liter pack happens to be around inr50. so the price index has gone up to 2.7 from something around 2.1. so going forward, we'll be increasing our value proposition to the consumers by introducing inr100 price points in the 1-litre category. this is on the 1 litre. as far as out-of-home consumption is concerned, which is inr10 price point, campa cola is at inr10 now. and even the big players like varun and hccb are also looking to cut the prices and will be available at inr15 price point. we have a tetra pak, which is available at inr20. so we've introduced inr10 bottle. we've introduced inr20 bottle. we've introduced inr65 bottle and also now 1 litre. is also available, and 2 litre. will also be available. so we are trying to plug all price points with juice-based drinks across. as far as the impact is concerned, i cannot directly correlate the impact, but we can feel a little bit of shift in this coming season from juice-based beverages to fizz-based drinks. firstly, the summer was a little bit acute and therefore, people preferred refreshment-based drinks rather than health based. but i think that was more momentary and transitory because of the price. so there is an impact, but it's an indirect impact of carbonated drinks on the juices. abneesh roy: mohit, two quick follow-ups here. one, in terms of the shift from the juice towards the fizz, would that be structural in nature? i know you are taking multiple steps to overcome it. one is if you could comment on margins, how it impacts because if you are becoming more sharper in terms of pricing, provided nothing changes, say, in raw material. what happens on margins? second, the awareness quotient clearly is increasing for customers. so the perception is though its fruit juice, but it is sweet. and the fruit content, obviously, people can easily read on the pack. and you also said that in the fizzy drink clearly, because it is so hot and so warm, there is a requirement.  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 so even if that is also sweet and maybe the non-sugar-wise anyway, that issue is not there. so i'm asking, is this a structural issue of more focus on health, so awareness is there. so do you need much more in terms of the r&d aspect to overcome it rather than just pricing? and what happens on the margins given the sharper pricing, which you have taken? mohit malhotra: as far as margins are concerned, the margins in the total juice portfolio have actually moved up. and that has happened because of the premiumisation at one end and also introducing the price points, which are more value offering to consumers on the other end. so both are kind of going hand-in-hand for us. so we've introduced coconut water also, so which are margin accretive to us. we've introduced value-added juices also, which are accretive to us, etc. so that is like kind of balancing our margin. and overall, our margins have actually moved up. as far as our representation in drinks, fizz and carbonated is concerned, we are also pivoting ourselves to have representation in carbonated and in drinks. so that has given us good benefit. as you know, we've got a inr200 crores business, which is a drinks portfolio and our fizz-based business, fruit-based fizz drinks for us has also done very well. we've also introduced cans in jammu, test marketed it and this has also done exceedingly well in the marketplace. so i think, a) pivoting the business towards refreshment besides health is there, b) fruit plus fizz which is the second vector of growth. coming to if there is a structural change? i don't think there is a structural change. if you look at overall big picture, a 50,000 ft -level view, you would find that the penetration of juices or fruit-based beverages in india is still 8% as compared to 25% in china. and that is the example that i can give you from our neighbouring markets. so i don't think there's a structural shift because the penetration of juices is still so low in the country and fruit is definitely considered more nourishing than only flavoured waters. so that's what my take would be. abneesh roy: sir, last quick question. so this inventory correction you have done, i wanted to ask on that. so clearly, fmcg companies keep doing it. the issue was that the quantum was extremely high. and we have not seen any other consumer company even talking about it currently. so what is different about your business since you are also very diversified. i understand in juice business there was a clear 2 quarters of issue. but how come it impacts overall business and the quantum if you can discuss that? second, you mentioned in the coming quarters, the growth will come back to normal. you also said that urban slowdown has bottomed out. now other companies are not saying that. they are saying this is start and so we need to watch out. so what is your confidence of saying urban has bottomed out? is it because you have taken the correction or it's more of a company-specific thing you are highlighting? mohit malhotra: so first, let me answer your second question first. i think as far as urban is concerned, why i say it has bottomed out is because if you look at the base effect, base quarter of urban was very high.  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 it's already gone down to around 2.8% kind of a growth in fmcg urban that we are seeing. i don't think so it's going to go beyond bottoming out from here. and if you really look at the intrinsic urban consumption, which is also driven by e-commerce, quick commerce, modern trade, etc, these channels are definitely showing a high growth, and they now contribute around 24% of the overall salience of our business. that is growing at a very high double digit, and that is 50% of the urban consumption as far as we are concerned. so that is showing no tell-tale signs of diminishing. so that is where i'm coming from. it's already bottomed out even in gt. so whether the consumption is happening through gt or through these emerging channels, something. so that's what my take would be that it has bottomed out. and as far as rural is concerned, rural remains resilient, and we see secondary growth in rural higher than urban by around 130 bps for us. but if i look at the nielsen data, our growth in rural is 600 basis points higher as compared to urban. so rural remains resilient and urban, in my view, should start recovering with the festive season. and we've seen the kharif acreage is also high. so that augurs well for rural, and there has been msp increases on the rabi crop also, which should give more disposable income in the hands of the consumer. but food inflation is something which is worrying me, which is in the range of around 9% and which is shifting the monies from discretionary to more essential items. so that was the first part of your question. as far as the extent of inventory correction is concerned, now extent of inventory correction was high, yes. we were deciding to take this inventory correction. but when we press the pedal on the 25th till that time, our business was doing very well. our hpc business till the 25th of september, hpc was growing at 9%; health care was growing at 8%; overall business was growing at 6% and beverage business was declining in secondary by 11%. so beverage business is the one which exacerbated the whole issue of inventory for us. and generally, beverage which is low shelf life product is high, as compared to hpc and hc businesses which have the 3-years of shelf life whereas beverage has only 6-month shelf life. it occupies a lot of space at the distributor end as well. so, the inventory piles up and the pressure is then felt on hc and hpc business because the entire ecosystem revolves around targets. so people have to do their numbers. so if one vertical doesn't fire, they try to push in the other vertical and therefore, inventory piles up. so when we took correction, the correction happened across the board for the entire portfolio, but more so in the beverage business. that's why optically the quantum is looking high for you. mihir shah from nomura mihir shah: so i wanted to check, would it be fair to assume that the gt inventory correction is now behind completely and 3q will be a normal growth quarter? and what according to you is normal growth in volume and value terms in the second half? so that's my first question. mohit malhotra: yes. so i think inventory correction is behind us. whatever inventory correction we had to do, we quickly did it in 1 month only rather than prolonging this pain for a long time. it's like a  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 disease is better to cure and correct it in one go. that we have done. so we've done corrections, but for health care business, which was preseason, and therefore, we loaded chyawanprash, so that is not compromised at all. in second half, we expect to grow back in mid- to high single- digits.. this is subject to good winters and fmcg also doing well. we will continue to grow ahead of the category and gain market share. so on the the overall strategy and big picture, i think matrices are fine. our market shares are going up, household penetrations are moving up our distribution is expanding. this is one-off correction, spring cleaning that we have done, and that too only on behest of our distributors, so that our roi of the distributors improves. and that's the feedback that we got. so very strong fundamentals of the business, which do not change at all. mihir shah: got it. i see the market shares are going up and maybe the inflationary environment is also kind of helping that from the unorganized players. but is it fair to assume that given dabur's rural saliency and winter saliency is high and la nina here, you should be geared to be a key beneficiary, and grow ahead of the markets and peers? i just wanted to get a confirmation on that. mohit malhotra: yes, absolutely. i have no doubts about it. i think we should be going ahead of the market with la nina here. i hope the winter is strong, more severe and more protracted so that chyawanprash business does well for us. we also have plans to recover our beverage business, which is a little pain point at the moment. mihir shah: understood. secondly, mohit, if you can just deep dive a little bit on the hair care portfolio, the hair oils, particularly. if you can give any qualification or quantification on how your dabur amla has done? and how do you see that portfolio shaping up? mohit malhotra: yes. so in hair oils, we are market leaders in the perfume category. as you know, we've got representation in perfumed oils where we have dabur amla and dabur amla has got this ring- fenced by the flanker brands, which is sarson amla, badam amla, etc. so the ring-fence brands promise economy to the consumer and therefore unbranded shift to those branded oils. dabur amla is our cash cow and that we are protecting from competitor, which is half the price here. and therefore, the flanker brands come in. we've done well in hair oils and perfumed hair oils, wherein we've gained around 120 bps in perfumed hair oil. so there is amla, there's sarson amla, then there is almond oil where also we have gained market shares from a single largest player in the market. plus, we launched cooling oils in the market, cool king. cool king this year will be around inr25 crores, and it's actually doing very well and the reception from the market is fantastic. so what we are doing is that we have a right to win in hair oils, and we are trying to plug. we are trying to have representations in different subsegments of hair oils. so cool king, we plugged organically. and with sesa coming in, we'll be plugging the ayurvedic segment. on hair oils, we make a gross margin of around 44%. with sesa coming in, it comes at around 57% gross margins. and those gross margins are coming without the scale of procurement of sesa private care as a company. with the scale of  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 dabur, we feel that we'll be able to take up the gross margins even further. if you look at the price points in the market, if amla is at inr0.45 per ml, this is at inr1.7 per ml. and so is kesh king at inr1.7 per ml. indulekha sits at around inr4.7 per ml.. so getting the leverage from our scale of procurement, i think this gross margins of 57% is also under-pitched. so this is plugging our premiumization strategy. this is plugging our white space strategy and solidifying and consolidating our core business of hair oils. plus it also has opportunity in international business, which contributes to 25% of our hair oils. for sesa brand, international business is only 11%. so that will critically go up to around 25%. but i think that's huge. like if we do around inr1,600 crores in india, we do overall around inr2,000 crores portfolio of hair oils we have in the overall kitty and sesa will only add on to that. yes. coconut oils, which is another subsegment for us, grew by around 14%, and we've gained market share. the market leader took price increases in coconut oil due to the inflation and so did we. the gross margins also inched up there in the coconut oils. so sesa can play in two categories for us. one is coconut-based ayurvedic oils. other is perfume-based ayurvedic oils. so we would want to compete in both the subcategories wherever the consumer need is, somewhere the consumer need is pre-bath, somewhere the consumer need is post bath. different markets have different consumer behaviours, and we would want to plug that gap here. so overall, in both the subsegments of coconut and perfume, we've gained market shares. so, on back of market shares, we feel the growth in this category for us will be higher as compared to the market growth rate. so this acquisition should not be seen from point of view of that the hair oil category. it's a low- growth category. it's been stagnant for the past 3-4 years, and therefore, why this acquisition. the real rationale for acquisition is we are a inr2,000 crores business, and we want to solidify this business as it's a core business, we have market shares of 16%, and we have huge headroom for growth in terms of market share gain. that is the way we see it, and that's the lens with which we want you to have a look at this. such distribution, if you look at dabur's distribution is 45 lakh outlets where hair oil goes to, the sesa brand only reaches out to around 6 to 6.5 lakhs thereabout. in terms of direct distribution also, they are available in 1.2 to 1.3 lakh outlets. we are available in around 3.5 to 4 lakh outlets. so, i think each of the places, we have miles to go. plus the penetration of ayurvedic hair oils, which are therapeutic hair oils, is only around 6% to 7%. and if you look at the overall market, the instance of perception of a hair problem or a hair fall is 60% and the penetration is only 6% with a huge headroom to grow here. plus, there is an extendibility of the brand. if you look at most of the market players like indulekha and kesh king, 20% of their business comes from shampoo business. and shampoo is a huge market, again with a high growth rate there of around 6% to 7%. 20% of the market is shampoo market, which is extended from ayurvedic. so this theoretically can  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 also be extended there. around 8% of sesa's business is coming from shampoo. that also has huge legs to grow and hair fall, shampoo can be a very big opportunity. mihir shah: mohit. great to know it is quite ring-fenced and seems to be like a good acquisition. my last question is actually on the health supplement business. you did mention chyawanprash grew by 12%, and that was a bit of a relief as well. do you expect this continue? because if you see over the past 3 years, on an absolute basis, the chyawanprash or health supplement absolute numbers has stagnated. do you expect growth to finally pick up in the second half in the winter in the health supplements business? and which ones did not do well, which led to overall growth to be lower at 2% for health supplements in q2 if chyawanprash grew by 12%? mohit malhotra: yes. so there is a no stop strategy here. so we are having no hold on to anything, whether it's advertising or it's activation or it's trade lubrication. i think we are working on all levers to ensure that chyawanprash comes back on track and back on the growth path. and hopefully, with la nina, i think chyawanprash should continue to grow. we've done the loading in the marketplace. now we are looking at secondaries to actually pick up in chyawanprash. we have introduced a format called khajurprash, which is basically meant for women and handles the iron deficiency in women also. its a very tasty variant as well. i will nudge you all to have it. if we are able to send across the sample to the investor community, we will definitely do the same. so, we've done innovation. we've also introduced small pack of chyawanprash for trials to be generated at around inr65 pack for increasing the penetration. in q2, we did a monsoon campaign to promote chyawanprash's all-weather consumption. chyawanprash has a perception that it's good only in winters. so, to kind of demystify that chyawanprash is an all-weather friend for building immunity, we did the monsoon campaign and monsoon campaign gave us great dividends in terms of this 12% growth that you see. so yes, we're keeping our fingers crossed that avi mehta from macquarie avi mehta: just first bit was on the margin side. with inventory correction largely driving almost 100 basis points contraction in reported margins at the operating level and a move towards giving higher value, could you help us understand how should we look at fy '25 margins? ankush jain: yes. i think widely at an h1 level, it is almost 100 bps correction. and now at least with some top line improvement foreseen in h2 with hopefully good winters and if the top line happens to the level of mid- to high single digits, then i think we should be able to leverage cost and protect margins for h2, so almost flattish margins at this level in h2. that will be our intent at least. avi mehta: fairly clear, fairly clear on that. and the second bit is on the sesa acquisition. now while i understand the strategic rationale, could you help me understand the eps impact over the next few years? because it seems at least on year 1, there is dilution, but you did point towards synergies. could you give us a sense on what are the synergies quantum that you're looking over here?  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 ankush jain: i think what will happen is, the process will go into some bit of merger and regulatory approval. it will take at least 1.5 to 2 years. the next 1.5 years, there will be no impact on dabur eps to start with. post that, we feel that once most of the synergies start coming in, the operating margin should inch up to 18% to 19%, which is similar to dabur once the complete synergies get in. avi mehta: okay. perfectly clear. and sorry, with your permission just a clarification. the mid- to high single-digit growth comment in the second half is on volume basis and the pricing growth of 2% odd expectation should sustain. that is correct, right? mohit malhotra: yes. we have a price increase of around 1.5% that we've done in h1, but the price increase impact got diluted by the trade and the extra value that we give on the top line. so that has kind of got nullified. so, it's a mid- to high single-digit kind of a growth rate that we are looking. it all depends upon how the market kind of behaves and grows. to the previous question, avi, want to mention that sesa business is really gross margin accretive, operating margin accretive and will provide leverage on all the cost heads to our hair oil portfolio, which is today giving me an operating margin of low double digit, which will end up giving me a high double-digit operating margin. so it will be a positive leverage on the operating margin for us. avi mehta: okay, that's very clear, mohit. perfect. thanks a lot for this and wish you all a very happy festive season. thank you very much. harit kapoor from investec harit kapoor: i just had two questions. one is on the improving the roi for the distributor part. so there are other ways as well in terms of credit periods etc, or probably at a numerator level, even taking the margin. just wanted to know, have any of those other pieces also been moved or it's only been reducing the inventory pipeline? and if it's only inventory days reduction at the distributor level, what's the quantum of that? and is it fair to assume that since you started this on 25th september, it was 6 days reduction? mohit malhotra: so the roi of distributor will be improved on back of the number of days of inventory that he's carrying. he was carrying inventory of 30 days. and as we speak after the correction, it will be around 21 days of inventory. so, roi substantially improves for him. the turnover remaining the same and the inventory correction will reduce the amount of investment that he has in the business. and therefore, there will be an improvement in the roi. that is what i think the question was. i hope i've been able to answer. harit kapoor: yes. just the question was really apart from this 9-day reduction, has there anything else been done, whether it's credit periods or overall percentage margin, etc? mohit malhotra: yes. for the past couple of months, we've been giving a little extra credit to the distributors also. so that has also gone up. because the inventory was high, there was inability on part of the distributor to extend that extra credit in the marketplace also because he watches his roi etc. so  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 i think that trade extensions will also go down, which we were offering earlier. the number three lever is that a lot of stockists used to have stockist salesmen on their payroll. we shifted them from their payroll to a third-party payroll, which is a team lease payroll, and some part of the margin was given back to them to improve their roi also. so all that is also happening alongside. plus this phenomena of roi reduction is more in urban india rather than rural india. so in urban, we are also providing some sort of subsidy to our distributors to ensure their rois come in. as far as rural is concerned, there's not too much of pain because the cost of doing business is much lower in rural as compared to urban. and urban also the shoe is pinching of the distributors because of the quick commerce and the e-commerce surge, which is happening. and some part is the price conflict, and some part is also offtake from the retail outlets in urban india going down and therefore, the inventory piling up, which will get corrected as we have reduced the inventory. and going forward, we are also looking at a way to do some sort of consolidation of distributors in urban india and not so much in rural. in rural, we will look at expansion of distribution, get into more number of villages and small towns and expand our distribution, divide our distribution into hpc, hc and foods and for urban looking at more consolidation. harit kapoor: got it. but any of these incremental initiatives over the next 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, in your view, should not have a material impact on the business from a disruption standpoint? mohit malhotra: no, i don't think there's any disruption in business. no, not at all. i don't think so. this was one- off. and this one-off also we've done in almost 20 years. dabur has never done it. and this is like a spring cleaning of the house, which was warranted once in a decade at least. so yes, maybe after a decade or so, you might expect it, i might not be there. so i don't think we foresee this happening again. harit kapoor: sure, sure. i'm not so sure if i'll be on a call after a decade as well, so. the second thing was on sesa. so you've very clearly mapped out the rationale. i just wanted to get your sense on how are you thinking of kind of category growth because certain interactions that we have for the top two players in this space also suggest that their growths have not been so flattering. so i'm sure you've kind of seen that when you evaluated this. i also see basis your numbers that there was a slightly lower rate of growth last year for this entity. so that's my first question on sesa. and the second one really is on the geographic mix, which part of the market does it have a higher salience? mohit malhotra: yes. so as far as sesa is concerned, i told you there are a couple of levers that make us so confident that we will continue to grow and grow at a higher pace, higher growth than what our hair oils is actually growing. it's a national brand, unlike badshah that we acquired, which is more of a western brand, and their contribution is very complementary to us. their contribution comes from central, which is the mainstay of dabur, which is up, bihar, etc, at 30% contribution.  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 west, which is low for dabur, they are high, which is 27% contribution coming from there. they are over-skewed on chemist channel and less skewed on grocery channel where dabur is high skewed on grocery and less skewed on chemist. so that provides opportunity as far as we are concerned. north for them is 11%, for dabur is skewed at around 25%, which is double. there, there is upside from our distribution is concerned. east, they are around 20% contribution and for dabur is about the same. and south, they are higher skewed, 11% contribution in south and dabur hair oil has low contribution coming from south and ayurvedic hair oils tend to be more salient in south. in bangladesh, where dabur is low, they have a higher presence. they are market leaders with 90% market share in the ayurvedic segment in bangladesh. so they will help, and it's a coconut market. so there, they help us to premiumize our entire portfolio in bangladesh. middle east, which is a huge 25% contributor to our overall global hair oil business, they are not present in middle east. so that entire place is up for taking. we have the rtm and the gtm established in around 20 countries in middle east, where they have zero presence whatsoever. so that's the upside that we have. in terms of sheer numbers, we have a direct reach of around 3 lakh to 4 lakh outlets. they have a direct reach of 1.2 lakh. so this direct reach immediately in our control. the moment we bolt on the distribution to our distribution. and the indirect distribution is around 6 lakhs as compared to us being around 45 lakhs. and this category will have to be advertised, and the high gross margins allow that kind of advertising to be done there. they've got 300-odd distributors. we have got around 3,000 distributors. so their presence in rural is low. our presence in rural with sub-stockist and yodha network is extremely high. so i think all these are very synergistic sort of opportunities, which we saw. and it's a premium hair oil and the extension possibilities are many, can be extended into shampoo, into serums, etc. and hair care, i told you an instance of 60% of problem solution, and they solve the problem solution space in the benefit segmentation in the consumer's mind. so all these things work in our favor. did i miss out any point of your question? i don't know. harit kapoor: no, fair point. if i have anything, i'll come back. prakash kapadia from spark pms prakash kapadia: two questions from my end. mohit, you alluded to food inflation being a big concern in urban demand. so any sense you could give us on down trading by consumers? is lup increasing? and you obviously mentioned you feel that from here on, growth should come back. so what's the outlook on urban demand coming back? that's the first question. and secondly, earlier for us and for most of the players in the fmcg business, gt was the real moat, direct and indirect partially, then came modern trade and then e-commerce and now it's quick commerce. so what does the future lie in terms of distribution and sustainable moat for us and your thoughts? mohit malhotra: right. so i'll answer your first question, prakash. so as far as urban is concerned, why i'm saying is urban has bottomed out because urban at the same time last year was growing at 11%. now  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 it's come down to 2.8%. i don't think urban demand will go down. the last urban demand went down was during the covid time to around minus 2%, 3%. and that was under the covid time. after that, i think 2.8% is the most bottom kind of demand that i've seen. and if you look at sequentially, i think the volumes in urban have grown sequentially from 2.1% in quarter 1 is now to 2.8%. if you look at the same period last year in quarter 3, the urban demand was 7.7%; from 7.7% on that base, i think it will be somewhere in the range of around 3%, 3.5%. and so i think rural and urban both will inch up like they've inched up. so it's a base effect also, which is kind of kicking in here, and we see urban demand picking up from here. and so the rural resilience is going to be picking up. now coming to food inflation, food inflation is definitely high. if you look at all the subsegments of fmcg growth, we find food is the one which is growing on back of value, on back of price increases, whether it's food, non-staples, or food staples. the rest, home care, otc, and personal care by far have remained flat. so i think with urban bottoming out, i see some amount of growth coming in even in the discretionary categories also. and as i told you, the acreage is higher, msps have gone up, so hopefully, food inflation should also tame going forward. and government has also called out on the food inflation. so there will be steps that the government will also take to tame the food inflation. the second part is modern trade, e-commerce, and quick commerce. i think one fundamental thing which is happening in india is that gt as a percentage salient will go down and e- commerce driven by quick commerce will only grow in the country. so what we are doing is that we are strengthening our relationship and bondages with e-commerce and quick commerce players and doing joint business planning with them, creating new products for them, connecting with them on a monthly, quarterly basis and seeing that we continuously grow shares in quick commerce and e-commerce portals, be it marketplaces like amazon, flipkart or be it quick commerce channel like swiggy, instamart, blinkit and zepto. our growth there is higher than their fmcg growth. so if they have grown by 50%, we've grown by 70% with them on their verticals. so we are ensuring that we grow market shares, and we continuously launch innovations which are very customized to these customers. as far as modern trade is concerned, our visibility is still little muted in modern trade and therefore on back of investment in modern trade and on back of gaining market shares from other players, i think modern trade for us should also continuously grow. but the quick commerce players are putting pressure on modern trade also besides gt. so if you look at the results of dmart and reliance retail, they are also a little under pressure today because the quick commerce and e-commerce is actually putting pressure on them also, and they would also be pivoting on multi-ways of distribution, whether it's electronically or through offline, etc.  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 so going forward, this gradual change from gt to mt to e-commerce is something which will endure. i don't think this is a flash in the pan and will disappear. i think this is enduring here, and this change will come. and how fast, we will have to watch. but gt is a very integral part today and will continue to be integral part because rural is a huge part of india. so at one end, we would be wanting to consolidate in urban india and other end, we would want to extend our distribution in rural. so keep expanding rural with sub-stockist and yodha channel which provide visibility to our business there so that assortment would go up, increase our direct reach in urban smaller cities, increase our direct reach in rural to have visibility and better assortment, reduce our reliance on wholesale and increase our direct reach. that is the fundamental strategy for rural and semi- urban markets. for metro markets, 8, 10 cities, i think, will keep expanding along with the quick commerce portals as they expand from 10 cities to 20 cities to maybe 100 cities going forward. sorry for a long answer, but yes. prakash kapadia: no, that's helpful. so what essentially you are alluding to is work with them and try and be part of that and do customization and see what sells and how much we can participate in that growth to adapt to this, right? mohit malhotra: absolutely. yes. prakash kapadia: fine. at least on the urban side. and rural still, i think the gt would continue to play a larger role. mohit malhotra: in terms of villages, we reach out to 1,20,000 villages. headroom is to go up to 6 lakh villages in the country. so huge headroom there. and in direct reach also, overall, dabur's direct plus indirect is 84 lakh outlets. we only go to something around 15 lakh outlets. so where is 15 lakh, and we should be minimum around 30% of 84 lakhs, so around 25 lakhs, and we are only in around 15 lakhs. so we can double our direct reach also. percy panthaki from iifl securities percy panthaki: i just wanted to know after this pipeline correction, what is the distributor days now? mohit malhotra: around 21 days, and we want to bring it down to around 19 days by end of december. ankush jain: and maybe just to add on even with 21 days, it's slightly on the higher side because we have loaded bit of chyawanprash to take care of season. percy panthaki: okay. so even in q3, basically, the primary will be lower than secondary by 2% approximately? mohit malhotra: no, no. percy panthaki: so then how will 21 come down to 19 then mohit? ankush jain: these inventory days are based on forward cover. hence, even in december end, we expect it to bring it to 19 to 20 days, maybe around 20 days.  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 percy panthaki: okay. on beverages, i just wanted to understand where the largest impact is. so you have the fruit drinks portfolio, then you have the nectars and then you have the juices. so where is the impact the most? i would assume it is in the fruit drinks, but just correct me if i'm wrong there. and secondly, the drinks that we had ventured into in a material way some 3 or 4 years ago, i believe in the first year, we had crossed inr100 crores, etc. so versus what was the peak turnover that we did in juices? and versus that, what is the sort of number that we are likely to do in fy '25? mohit malhotra: okay. let me answer this question. our complete beverage portfolio is divided into 4 parts. now first part is coconut water. our coconut water, we were struck by storia last year, who came out with a pet bottle. so just to tell you, it's a good news that we've bounced back by giving a lot of value in coconut water and the market shares have gone up by 200 basis points. the overall activ coconut portfolio has increased by 16% in terms of secondary. so that's one part of the portfolio. the active 100% juices for us has not got impacted by the season. i think this is premium portfolio for us, which is 7.3% growth, which quarter to august was also growing by around 18%, 19% for us, and it's the most margin-accretive portfolio. so that is the second part of the portfolio. the third part of the portfolio is a drinks portfolio. which registered a turnover of around inr200 crores. in the current year, we've got a growth of around 16% in this portfolio. but the 16% growth is excluding east, where we were the hardest hit because of the northeast. our per capita consumption of juices is the highest in northeast in india, highest. and northeast was reeling under floods in the quarter 2, and that was a wettest monsoon that we could see in the northeast, and that was hit. minus northeast, our growth was 16%, 17%. northeast impacted and the growth became negative to around 8%. but drinks is not what has got impacted so much. the real impact which has happened in the nectar business. our nectar business has declined by minus 12%. so drinks, activ coconut and real fizz which is the carbonated portfolio. carbonated portfolio grown by 100% for us. so therefore, there's a tailwind towards carbonate, albeit very small for us, but around 70%, 80% of the portfolio is real nectar, which is where we got impacted the most, which declined by around 12%. percy panthaki: and that decline is basically customers' preferences towards more cheaper alternatives? or is there anything else towards that decline? mohit malhotra: i think the entire category declined by around 8.6% in terms of volume. we gained a market share of 230 bps. so, if you compare to relative performance vis-a-vis tropicana or slice or b- natural, real is surely a preferred choice among the consumer in the juices and nectars' market. so market shares have gone up. so it's a very good sign. so in nielsen data, we've grown higher than the category. that's one. but category itself is declining. so i think tetra pack is moving to bottles. the consumer preference is they want to see what they are having. so in tetra pack, we've launched a 1-litre bottle. we have launched a 2-litre bottle. we've launched a 500 ml bottle and there is a 200 ml bottle also at all price points of  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 inr10, inr20, inr100. that is the price point that we have plugged with nectars as well. so that should take care of the problem. percy panthaki: is the problem in nectar is that the average price per litre. or per 100 or 200 ml, whatever you count it, that is much more expensive versus some of the cheaper options like colas, etc, as you called out that campa is sort of giving a lot more value, although it's not a comparable product, but it's like an imperfect substitute. and therefore, people are saying that this is not something that is affordable in light of the other options available in the market, and that's why this category is declining. is that understanding, correct? mohit malhotra: yes, that is a correct understanding. there is a price difference because campa for 1 litre., which is a party pack and in-home consumption is available at a inr45 –and forget campa, even pepsi or coke is available at around inr50 for a 1-litre price point. and as compared to real, which is 70% market share player, it's available at inr130. so there is a definite difference between the 2 things, yes. percy panthaki: but mohit, if this is the reason, then what is the solution? because then we don't see an end in sight, and this can keep declining for many more quarters. so is there an end in sight? and is there a solution if this is the root cause? mohit malhotra: so therefore, the solution to this is we have pivoted into drinks. drinks are pegged at a similar price point as soft drinks. that's exactly what i explained to you, inr10, inr20, inr50 and inr100 price point, drink is pegged at par with the carbonated and fruit-based fizz drinks are also at par. that said, it is a small base. so therefore, it cannot compensate for the 80% of the nectar business. we have to provide value in the nectar business also. therefore, we are introducing a inr100 tropical juices in nectars. and also, we are planning to give a value on nectar by giving a tangible goody there. so that is what we are trying to do. but i think it's a matter of time before the pricing will get normalized and this cola war should end, and we have been a little collateral damage in this cola war for past 6 months or so. but i don't think that is the only problem. i think it's more monsoon and season, which created havoc for beverage. percy panthaki: got it, mohit. that's all from me. thanks and all the best. kunal vora from bnp paribas kunal vora: first question on namaste litigation, how much did you spend in first half? and what's the status now? how much longer do you expect to continue spending on it? ankush jain: yes. so in fact, in first half, we have spent around inr40 crores to inr45 crores, and we expect around inr85 crores to inr90 crores in full year. last year, it was inr110-odd crores on a yearly basis. so there is a reduction in cost because there has been some optimization, not only in terms of lawyers, but also in terms of their management and more optimization of the lawyers. mohit malhotra: so therefore, we've got a inr20-30 crores of saving from last year's base on the litigation cost on namaste. that said, this is all a provision that we are keeping in our books. as the insurance  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 company gives us a guarantee to pay, this part of this provision can be reversed depending upon the case that we are fighting. kunal vora: understood. and is there a visibility on when does this end? ankush jain: we think around 1.5 years from now is the best estimate which we have got from various lawyers interaction. but knowing u.s., it can do plus/minus 6 months or thereabouts. kunal vora: understood. second is, how do you supply to quick commerce? how does it work? are you supplying directly or through distributors? and how are the margins offered to quick commerce companies versus like overall portfolio? and as the distribution, which was like fragmented earlier through gt, now like there is a consolidation happening with modern trade and e- commerce, especially in cities. is there a risk which you see to the margins? mohit malhotra: yes. so we guys used to supply to quick commerce and modern trade through our gt stockist. but i think around 1.5 years back, we've started direct supplies to the quick commerce players. let's take an example of blinkit, so we supply from our side to the blinkit warehouses. there are roughly around 20 to 30 warehouses they have. from those 20 warehouses, they supply to 500 to 600 dark stores. from the dark stores, it goes to the consumer. so that's the supply chain which is there, from us to the quick commerce players, all of them, whether it's zepto or a blinkit or it is swiggy. as far as margins are concerned, our margins are around 100 to 200 basis points higher in quick commerce as compared to e-commerce marketplaces. and moreover, compared to gt also, our margins are higher because we sell larger packs to them and tots are better as compared to modern trade. kunal vora: understood. but how do you see this consolidation happening on the other side, modern trade, e-commerce, they become larger, they will have like higher bargaining power. do you think this can be a longer-term risk to the margin? mohit malhotra: yes, we used to think that there could be a consolidation. but knowing india, i think question of consolidation doesn't arise. now everybody is pivoting towards being a quick commerce player. so if you look at big basket is also a quick commerce, and amazon is also wanting to become a big quick commerce. tata is becoming a quick commerce. you heard the news today. so i think one after the other, there will be many players. flipkart has introduced ‘minutes’ as a quick commerce player. so therefore, there will be multiple quick commerce players and the bargaining power shifting in their hands is very difficult when there are many players. so i think it will remain in our hands only, and there are so many manufacturers. so as the market democratizes and more and more quick commerce players come in, i think because of the competitive intensity, margins will be where they are. so i don't think margins will go up. kunal vora: how are the distributors reacting to you supplying directly to various large players like quick commerce and modern trade versus through distributors earlier?  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 mohit malhotra: as far as distributor is concerned, there is a distributor consortium of all india consumer product distributors federation. they are up in arms against all these quick and e-comm players, and they have made representations to the commerce ministry against the predatory pricing because so many of these quick commerce players are private equity funded and they subsidize products, come out with events like big billion day etc and they deep discount the products which become loss leaders and hence attract footfalls for them. and then that disrupts the gt market. and as far as the general trade is concerned, they are also the vote bank of the government. so government can't afford not to appease them. and that's why you've heard so many articles of government against the predatory pricing of these quick commerce players. so i think it's a larger question there. so obviously, stockists have not taken it in good taste of what's happening on quick commerce. but you can't help it. so you have to bypass the stockist and go to them because their terms of trade and their want of products is such which only company themselves can fulfil. dark store keeps an inventory of 3 days, not more than 3 days, which distributors can't fill in, which only a company edi direct connect with the blinkit edi can fulfil on a replenishment basis in their warehouse. it's not possible for them to supply the entire assortment, which may be required by quick commerce players. kunal vora: understood, very helpful. thank you, that was from my side. shirish pardeshi from centrum stock broking shirish pardeshi: it was a bit excited to not get into the much deeper on the inventory and other thing. but you mentioned in the opening slide, quick commerce growing at a rapid pace. and you just mentioned that the dark store inventory is sub minimal at 3, 4 days. so rather than looking at the front end and the distributor connect, do we need to have a breakthrough innovation in the supply chain at the back end so that the distributor inventory correction issue will not come in future? mohit malhotra: so i think the back end is supply chain. so on supply chain, we are actually trying to do an experiment with the blinkit etc, to have a direct connect with them, connecting our internal supply chain of our warehouse to their dark store, but seems very difficult because they keep a very low inventory, and they don't have a backup there. and as far as distributors are concerned, we are trying a model, something like where an app can be given to a distributor or retailer so that direct orders can be sent to us and the delivery and the cash management can happen from the distributor. so we are trying and experimenting multiple models on digital to see how to navigate this problem. but the short-term solve for us was inventory correction and also moving the salesmen on a third-party payroll and refunding and a little bit of subsidy to be given to them to improve their profitability. i don't know if i answered your question correctly. shirish pardeshi: yes. so, having spent time in fmcg at the front end, i was more curious because have you done any studies, say, for example, bombay, delhi or for example, bombay, if we would have been doing on an average, about inr25 crores, inr30 crores on a month basis. and there is a quick  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 commerce, e-commerce, and modern trade, which is flourishing. is there an actual demand which has been getting crushed because i still don't understand people are pointing out the urban demand is coming down. is there any study or is there any depth you can give me? mohit malhotra: so as far as urban demand is concerned, i don't think urban demand is really coming down. overall, fmcg urban is under pressure because of food inflation that is understood. but this urban demand is getting catered through e-commerce and quick commerce because the consumer behaviour is changing to wanting to shop digitally and online and not go to a nearby kirana store. and what nielsen does is, which is a syndicated data that the entire industry refers to looking at the consumer demand in urban, they generally track the gt and the pop and mom stores and not so much the quick commerce or the e-commerce players. they track mt and they track gt. so a lot of demand, which is there on e-commerce and quick commerce is perhaps not getting captured by the data which is there in urban today. so that is also an issue. ankush jain: yes. maybe just to add on, while there's no study on this, but the impulsive purchase because of quick commerce probably the demand is actually getting generated, but it's not getting captured. that may be a hypothesis. shirish pardeshi: no, i'm more curious, sorry, i'm hopping on this. though we have a product portfolio, maybe because of that, we need to keep our inventory at the higher level. but then if i look back, there are so much variation. certain companies, i don't want to name, they keep an inventory of maybe about 5, 6 days, and there are certain companies who keep the inventory more than a month. so that's what my question was, that at the back-end innovation because we have digital and ai, which is coming up, so what is the issue to reinvent? anyway, i'll take it offline. my second question is on the skin care and the health care portfolio, in healthcare specifically otc and ethical, we are doing better. but in this quarter, the growth rate, which was mentioned in the presentation, is flat. so is there a sharper inventory correction, and has it been done consciously?, is the inventory under control now or we will have further impact on this? mohit malhotra: okay. skin care, as far as skin care is concerned, i think the real growth will happen in winter. skin care consumption for us is more winter skewed. so i think we have a winter portfolio, and we expect skin care to actually pick up. as far as market shares are concerned, we've gained market shares in fem also, which is more bleaches. so overall, i think skin care is doing okay. the secondaries being down in skin care, i think, was more of a collateral damage because of the inventory correction that we've done. it's a small percentage of our portfolio. and therefore, secondary may have suffered because of that. as far as health care is concerned, i think all verticals of health care continue to do well for us. so i told you chyawanprash is 12% growth. even in honey we gained market share, a little bit of crystallization problem is behind us. glucose wasn't salient. our baby care portfolio grew by around 30%.. our lal tail continued to grow. shilajit had a very high double-digit growth. hajmola did well under the digestive portfolio.  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 so i think otc, digestives, all portfolios did well for us. now i think if you're talking about honitus, which would have declined a little bit, i think that is on account of the high bases that we have in honitus. that's why decline was there in honitus. otherwise, i think all verticals of health care did reasonably well. shirish pardeshi: okay. my last question on the international business, though we have done a very good job there. but is there any further room in terms of margin improvement? because last time when we had a physical meeting, we were banking on the international business will show some good profitability path. mohit malhotra: yes. so international business is doing well. and i think one good thing on the margins is that our middle east, north africa, which is the most margin-accretive geography in the entire region is doing well. and we have a lot of innovations, as i was telling you, that oral care is something that we are doubling down, and oral care profitability is also pretty high in international business, that we are doubling down in. dabur red is one of the high-priced toothpastes. so i think on back of that, we will expect the margin improvement to happen. so, currency depreciation is something which arises in international. but as we lap over the currencies, now it's been happening over a year. and if you look at the first half also, we are down by inr181 crores on the currency depreciation. and this currency depreciation is a translation loss. there is also a transaction loss that happens because a lot of the products in international are imported by us, and they have to pay a dollar currency for the import of that, especially in turkey market. so therefore, as we lap over the currencies, i think our margins will only improve in egypt and in turkey, which are very high salient markets for us. shirish pardeshi: okay thank you mohit and ankush happy diwali to you. vishal punmiya from yes securities vishal punmiya: just one question from my side. so historically, we have been a key participator in the maha kumbh melas. what are your plans for this year? and if you can also talk about the benefits as well as the cost that go behind this event? mohit malhotra: yes. so i think for us, we are a rural salient company. 50% of the business comes from rural. and in rural, activations is a very big avenue to touch, feel and experience the product by the consumer. and we are very aggressive in terms of taking hoardings and doing experiential marketing. last time when kumbh was there, we did a special rtp campaign in kumbh and had rtp taps that consumer could come to and take a toothbrush and take rtp on that and use it. and the more they try, the more conviction they build in the product and the more they buy. so this year also, we'll be participating in maha kumbh. and we also participated in other melas like pandharpur mela, nauchandi mela etc., which is a very huge congregation of consumers, to provide them experience with our product. now we have cool king, so we do special chumpies in these melas also, do auto branding, van branding, retail branding, stall branding etc. vishal punmiya: sir, is there any major benefit that comes in? or is it more lag in terms of demand improvement from all these events?  dabur india limited october 30, 2024 mohit malhotra: so it's a demand improvement that we get and which results in a better offtake and also sampling. so the more people sample, the more sampling happens, the more cascade effective trials and therefore, repeat purchase and market share moves up. so it's very tangible actually. vishal punmiya: understood. just quickly on the high interest cost and other income for the quarter, quickly you can comment on that? that was from my side. ankush jain: yes. so first of all, you see other income and interest cost jointly. and if you see it jointly, it is almost 18%. in india, it grew by 7%, but in international, it grew by almost 18% or thereabouts. and this is primarily because in international geographies, we had some benefit, especially in dubai, where some of the yields almost got doubled in certain international markets because of inflation and therefore, the interest rates going up. so that was the main reason for other income net increasing by 18%. vishal punmiya: thank you and happy diwali to team. isha lamba: i would like to thank all the participants for joining today's call. the webcast recording and transcript will be available on our website. thank you and wish you all a very happy diwali."
