We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review\nEngagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of\nthe Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information\nconsists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and\napplying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit\nconducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, and\nconsequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters\nthat might be identified in an audit.

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of the standalone unaudited financial results\n(‘the Statement’) of Britannia Industries Limited (‘the Company’) for the quarter ended 30 September 2024\nand the year to date results for the period 01 April 2024 to 30 September 2024, being submitted by the\nCompany pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure\nRequirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (‘Listing Regulations’).\n2. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s management and approved by the Company’s\nBoard of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid\ndown in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (‘Ind AS 34’), prescribed under\nSection 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’), and other accounting principles generally accepted in\nIndia and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing\nRegulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review.\n3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review\nEngagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of\nthe Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information\nconsists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and\napplying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit\nconducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, and\nconsequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters\nthat might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\nChartered Accountants Walker Chandiok & Co LLP is registered\nwith limited liability with identification\nOffices in Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Chennai, Dehradun, Gurugram, Hyderabad, Kochi, Kolkata, Mumbai, New Delhi, number AAC-2085 and its registered office\nNoida and Pune at L-41 Connaught Circus, New Delhi,\n110001, India\n4. Based on our review conducted as above nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that\nthe accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid\ndown in Ind AS 34, prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally\naccepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the\nrequirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)\nRegulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any\nmaterial misstatement.\nFor Walker Chandiok & Co LLP\nChartered Accountants\nFirm Registration No: 001076N/N500013\nAasheesh Arjun Singh\nPartner\nMembership No. 210122\nUDIN: 24210122BKEWMP9370\nBengaluru\n11 November 2024\nChartered Accountants\nBRITANNIA INDUSTRIES LIMITED\n(Corporate Identity Number: L15412WB1918PLC002964)\nRegistered Office: 5/1A, Hungerford Street, Kolkata ‐ 700 017\nTel: +91 33 22872439/2057, +91 80 37687100\nWebsite: www.britannia.co.in; E‐mail id:investorrelations@britindia.com\nExtract of Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results for the quarter and six months ended 30 September 2024\n(₹ in Crores)\nParticulars Quarter ended Six months ended Quarter ended\n30.09.2024 30.09.2024 30.09.2023\nTotal revenue from operations 4 ,667.57 8,917.86 4,432.88\nNet profit / (Loss) for the period (before tax, exceptional and/or extraordinary items) 715.30 1,421.04 798.63\nNet profit / (Loss) for the period before tax (after exceptional and/or extraordinary items) 715.15 1 ,396.25 798.63\nNet profit / (Loss) for the period after tax (after exceptional and/or extraordinary items) 531.55 1,036.43 586.50\nTotal comprehensive income for the period\n[Comprising Net Profit / (Loss) for the period (after tax) and Other comprehensive income (after tax)] 533.01 1,039.27 589.39\nEquity share capital 24.09 2 4.09 2 4.09\nOther equity 3 ,186.23\nEarnings per share (face value of ₹ 1 each) (for continuing and discontinued operations) ‐\n(a) Basic (₹) 2 2.06 4 3.06 2 4.41\n(b) Diluted (₹) 2 2.06 4 3.06 2 4.41\nExtract of Unaudited Standalone Financial Results for the quarter and six months ended 30 September 2024\n(₹ In Crores)\nQuarter ended Six months ended Quarter ended\nParticulars\n30.09.2024 30.09.2024 30.09.2023\nTotal revenue from operations 4,500.84 8,595.28 4,288.85\nNet profit / (Loss) for the period (before tax, exceptional and/or extraordinary items) 695.00 1 ,395.29 781.74\nNet profit / (Loss) for the period before tax (after exceptional and/or extraordinary items) 694.85 1,370.50 781.74\nNet profit / (Loss) for the period after tax (after exceptional and/or extraordinary items) 514.41 1,016.49 570.49\nTotal comprehensive income for the period\n[Comprising Net Profit / (Loss) for the period (after tax) and Other comprehensive income (after tax)] 514.41 1,016.49 570.49\nEquity share capital 24.09 2 4.09 2 4.09\nOther equity 2,749.54\nEarnings per share (face value of ₹ 1 each) (for continuing and discontinued operations) ‐\n(a) Basic (₹) 21.36 4 2.20 2 3.68\n(b) Diluted (₹) 21.36 4 2.20 2 3.68\nNotes:\n1.Theaboveisanextractofthedetailedformatoftheunauditedfinancialresultsforthequarterandsixmonthsended30September2024('theresults'),filedwiththeStockExchangesunderRegulation33oftheSecuritiesandExchange\nBoardofIndia('SEBI')(ListingObligationsandDisclosureRequirements)Regulations,2015.Thefullformatoftheunauditedfinancialresultsforthequarterandsixmonthsended30September2024isavailableonthewebsiteoftheStock\nExchanges ‐ www.nseindia.com and www.bseindia.com and is also available on the Company's website ‐ www.britannia.co.in.\n2.Theunauditedfinancialresultsforthequarterandsixmonthsended30September2024('theresults')oftheCompanyhavebeenpreparedinaccordancewithIndianAccountingStandards('IndAS')prescribedunderSection133of\nCompanies Act, 2013 ('The Act') read with the relevant rules thereunder and in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.\n3.TheoperatingsegmentoftheCompanyisidentifiedtobe\"Foods\",astheChiefOperatingDecisionMakerreviewsbusinessperformanceatanoverallcompanylevelasonesegment.Therefore,thedisclosureasperRegulation33(1)(e)\nread with Clause (L) of Schedule IV of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 is not applicable to the Company.\n4.

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of the consolidated unaudited financial results (‘the Statement’) of Britannia Industries Limited (‘the Holding Company’) and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as ‘the Group’), its associates and joint venture (refer Annexure 1 for the list of subsidiaries, associates and joint venture included in the Statement) for the quarter ended 30 September 2024 and the consolidated year to date results for the period 01 April 2024 to 30 September 2024, being submitted by the Holding Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (‘Listing Regulations’). 2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company’s management and approved by the Holding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (‘Ind AS 34’), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. We also performed procedures in accordance with the SEBI Circular CIR/CFD/CMD1/44/2019 dated 29 March 2019 issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33 (8) of the Listing Regulation, to the extent applicable.

Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of the standalone unaudited financial results (‘the Statement’) of Britannia Industries Limited (‘the Company’) for the quarter ended 30 September 2024 and the year to date results for the period 01 April 2024 to 30 September 2024, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (‘Listing Regulations’). 2. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s management and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (‘Ind AS 34’), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Based on our review conducted as above nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of the consolidated unaudited financial results (‘the Statement’) of Britannia Industries Limited (‘the Holding Company’) and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as ‘the Group’), its associates and joint venture (refer Annexure 1 for the list of subsidiaries, associates and joint venture included in the Statement) for the quarter ended 30 September 2024 and the consolidated year to date results for the period 01 April 2024 to 30 September 2024, being submitted by the Holding Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (‘Listing Regulations’). 2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company’s management and approved by the Holding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (‘Ind AS 34’), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. We also performed procedures in accordance with the SEBI Circular CIR/CFD/CMD1/44/2019 dated 29 March 2019 issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33 (8) of the Listing Regulation, to the extent applicable.

Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of the standalone unaudited financial results (‘the Statement’) of Britannia Industries Limited (‘the Company’) for the quarter ended 30 September 2024 and the year to date results for the period 01 April 2024 to 30 September 2024, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (‘Listing Regulations’). 2. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s management and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (‘Ind AS 34’), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Based on our review conducted as above nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
