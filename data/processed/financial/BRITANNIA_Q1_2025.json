A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. We also performed procedures in accordance with the SEBI Circular CIR/CFD/CMD1/44/2019 dated 29 March 2019 issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33 (8) of the Listing Regulation, to the extent applicable.

Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
