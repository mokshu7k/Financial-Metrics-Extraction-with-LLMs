We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited consolidated financial results ('the\nStatement') of Dabur India Limited ('the Holding Company') and its subsidiaries (the Holding\nCompany and its subsidiaries together referred to as 'the Group') and its joint venture (refer\nAnnexure 1 for the list of subsidiaries and joint venture included in the Statement) for the quarter\nended 31 December 2024 and the consolidated year to date results for the period 01 April 2024\nto 31 December 2024, being submitted by the Holding Company pursuant to the requirements\nof Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations\nand Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars\nissued by the SEBI from time to time.\n2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company's management and\napproved by the Holding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with\nthe recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34,\nInterim Financial Reporting ('Ind AS 34'), prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act,\n2013 ('the Act'), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in\ncompliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation\n52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)\nRegulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to\ntime. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review.\n3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review\nEngagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the\nIndependent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A\nreview of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons\nresponsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review\nprocedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with\nthe Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does\nnot enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that\nmight be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\nThe performance of procedures in accordance with the SEBI Circular CIR/CFD/CMD1/44/2019\ndated 29 March 2019 issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33 (8) of the SEBI (Listing\nObligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), is not applicable\nherein considering all entities (except for the one referred to in para 5 below) under\nconsolidation are audited by us.\n4. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above,\nnothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement,\nprepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS\n34, prescribed under section 1 33 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted\nin India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the\nrequirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEB1 (Listing\nObligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including the\nmanner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.\nF>.SU\n'o c?\n0 0\n* •*\nn K ATA\nx fS\n- ' ^ •^p ^;? • ? ^ -\n^ACGr\nTELEPHONE : 2212-6253, 2212-8016 BASU HOUSE\nFAX : 00-91-33.2212 7476 G.

The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's management and approved by the\nCompany's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and\nmeasurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial\nReporting ('Ind AS 34'), prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act'),\nand other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the\npresentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with\nRegulation 63oftheSEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015\n(as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. Our\nresponsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review.\n3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review\nEngagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the\nIndependent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A\nreview of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons\nresponsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review\nprocedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with\nthe Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does\nnot enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that\nmight be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.\n4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to\nbelieve that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and\nmeasurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under section 133 of the Act, and\nother accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information\nrequired to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation\n52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)\nRegulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it\ncontains any material misstatement.\nFor G Basu & Co\nChartered Accountants\nFirm Registration No: 301174E\n^^\n^.^—' fsfZ^\n0\n)' ^rv^~' f^KOUKATAy•*\n^\nSubroto Lahiri\n^—^^\nPartner ^ % <<) ^\nMembership No. 051717\n: ^5o?;/7/7^^oxPx6c'07\nUDIN\nPlace: New Delhi\nDate : 30 January 2025\nDabur India Limited ^\nStatement of unaudited standalone financial results for the quarter and nine months ended 31 December 2024\n'DaSur\n(? in crores)\nSI.No [Particulars Quarter ended Preceding Corresponding Nine months Corresponding Previous year\n(31/12/2024) quarter ended quarter ended ended nine months ended\n(30/09/2024) (31/12/2023) (31/12/2024) ended (31/03/2024)\n(31/12/2023)\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) | (Unaudited) (Audited)\n1 Income\nRevenue from operations 2,448.26 2,143.58 2,414.36 7,106.00 7,096.14 9,135.60\nOther income 105.31 118.46 101.86 333.39 303.44 417.62\nTotal income 2,553.57 2,262.04 2,516.22 7,439.39 7,3S9.58 9,553.22\n2 Expenses\nCost of materials consumed 781.80 844.02 791.04 2,485.41 2,520.88 3,300.25\nPurchases of stock in trade 445.50 440.96 388.88 1,336.52 1,197.26 1,579.05\nChanges in inventories of finished goods, stock-in-trade and work-in-progress 39.70 (141.29) 100.06 29.17 107.46 43.18\nEmployee benefits expense 205.98 208.05 196.89 616.62 587.85 782.14\nFinance costs 28.33 28.92 23.92 76.74 57.69 81.14\nDepreciation and amortisation expense 63.78 63.83 52.17 187.71 154.67 208.86 |\nOther expenses\nAdvertisement and publicity 166.04 164.87 189.74 519.63 530.10 675.97\nOthers 226.63 223.76 216.23 695.96 650.09 909.93\nTotal expenses 2,017.82 1,833.12 1,958.93 5,947.76 5,806.00 7,586.52\n3 | Profit before exceptional items and tax 535.75 428.92 557.29 1,491.63 1,593.58 1,966.70\n4 Exceptional items\n5 Profit before tax 535.75 428.92 557.29 1,491.63 1,593.58 1,966.70\n6 Tax expense\nCurrent tax 114.67 96.71 125.17 329.95 357.52 443.80\nDeferred tax 3.00 3.00 4.00 9.00 10.00 13.69\n7 Net profit for the period/year (A) 418.08 329.21 428.12 1,152.68 1,226.06 1,509.21\n8 Other comprehensive income\na) Items that will not be redassified to profit or loss (1.14) (1.54) 5.15 (3.42) 15.73 (2.97)1\nIncome tax relating to items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss 0.40 0.54 (1.80) 1.20 (5.50) 1.04\nb) Items that will be reclassified to profit or loss (1.43) 43.36 13.95 54.90 29.11 47.61\nIncome tax relating to items that will be reclassified to profit or loss 0.33 (10.10) (3.25) (12.79) (6.78) (11.09)1\n9 |Total other comprehensive income/floss) for the period/year (B) (1.84) 32.26 14.05 39.89 32.56 34.59\n10 |Total comprehensive income forthe period/year (A+B) 416.24 361.47 442.17 1,192.57 1,258.62 1,543.80\n11 I Paid-up equity share capital (Face value of ? 1 each) 177.23 177.23 177.20 177.23 177.20 177.20\n12 | Other equity 6,738.17\n13 Earnings per share (Face value of ^ 1 each) (not annualised)\nBasic (?) 2.36 1.86 2.42 6.50 6.92 S.52\nDiluted (?) 2.35 1.85 2.41 6.49 6.90 8.50\n^\n^\n1^\nDabur India Limited ^i^i-1\nUnaudited standalone segment wise revenue, results, assets and liabilities for the quarter and nine months ended 31 December 2024\n»/fl\"\n(? in crores)\nSI.No Particulars Quarter ended Preceding quarter] Corresponding Nine months Corresponding Previous year\n(31/12/2024) ended quarter ended ended nine months ended\n(30/09/2024) (31/12/2023) (31/12/2024) ended (31/03/2024)\n(31/12/2023)\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) | (Unaudited) (Audited)\n1 Segment revenue\nA.

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited consolidated financial results ('the Statement') of Dabur India Limited ('the Holding Company') and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as 'the Group') and its joint venture (refer Annexure 1 for the list of subsidiaries and joint venture included in the Statement) for the quarter ended 31 December 2024 and the consolidated year to date results for the period 01 April 2024 to 31 December 2024, being submitted by the Holding Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. 2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company's management and approved by the Holding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting ('Ind AS 34'), prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act'), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review. 3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. The performance of procedures in accordance with the SEBI Circular CIR/CFD/CMD1/44/2019 dated 29 March 2019 issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33 (8) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), is not applicable herein considering all entities (except for the one referred to in para 5 below) under consolidation are audited by us. 4. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under section 1 33 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEB1 (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

According to the information and explanations given to us by the management, this interim financial information is not material to the Group.

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results ('the Statement') of Dabur India Limited ('the Company') for the quarter ended 31 December 2024 and the year to date results for the period from 01 April 2024 to 31 December 2024, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. 2. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's management and approved by the Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting ('Ind AS 34'), prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act'), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63oftheSEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review. 3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under section 133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited consolidated financial results ('the Statement') of Dabur India Limited ('the Holding Company') and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as 'the Group') and its joint venture (refer Annexure 1 for the list of subsidiaries and joint venture included in the Statement) for the quarter ended 31 December 2024 and the consolidated year to date results for the period 01 April 2024 to 31 December 2024, being submitted by the Holding Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. 2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company's management and approved by the Holding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting ('Ind AS 34'), prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act'), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review. 3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. The performance of procedures in accordance with the SEBI Circular CIR/CFD/CMD1/44/2019 dated 29 March 2019 issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33 (8) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), is not applicable herein considering all entities (except for the one referred to in para 5 below) under consolidation are audited by us. 4. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under section 1 33 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEB1 (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

According to the information and explanations given to us by the management, this interim financial information is not material to the Group.

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results ('the Statement') of Dabur India Limited ('the Company') for the quarter ended 31 December 2024 and the year to date results for the period from 01 April 2024 to 31 December 2024, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. 2. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's management and approved by the Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting ('Ind AS 34'), prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act'), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63oftheSEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review. 3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under section 133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
