We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section\n143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the\nAuditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Statement section of our report. We are\nindependent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of\nChartered Accountants of India ('the ICAI') together with the ethical requirements that are\nrelevant to our audit of the financial results under the provisions of the Act and the rules\nthereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these\nrequirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us, is\nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Statement\n4. This Statement has been prepared on the basis of the standalone annual financial statements\nand has been approved by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company's Board of\nDirectors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Statement that gives a true\nand fair view of the net profit/loss and other comprehensive income and other financial\ninformation of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS specified under section 133 of the\nAct, read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and other accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in India, and in compliance with Regulation 33 and Regulation\n52 read with Regulation 63 of the Listing Regulations. This responsibility also includes\nmaintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for\nsafeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other\nirregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments\nand estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance\nof adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy\nand completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of\nthe Statement that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether\ndue to fraud or error.\nTELEPHONE : 2212-6253, 2212-80K)\nBASU HOUSE\nFAX : 00-91-33-2212 7476\nG.

In preparing the Statement, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's\nability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going\nconcern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either\nintends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to\ndo so.\n6. The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting\nprocess.\nAuditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Statement\n7. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement as a whole is\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report\nthat includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a\nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing, specified under\nsection 143(10) of the Act, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the\naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users\ntaken on the basis of this Statement.\n8. As part of an audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing, specified under section\n143(10) of the Act, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism\nthroughout the audit. We also:\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Statement, whether due to\nfraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain\naudit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk\nof not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting\nfrom error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit\nprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act,\nwe are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has in place\nan adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and the\noperating effectiveness of such controls.\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of\naccounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.\nConclude on the appropriateness of the management's use of the going concern basis of\naccounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty\nexists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's\nability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we\nare required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the\nStatement or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions\nare based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However,\nfuture events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going\nconcern.\nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Statement, including the\ndisclosures, and whether the Statement represents the underlying transactions and events\nin a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n9. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the\nplanned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant\ndeficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nTELEPHONE : 2212-6253, 2212-801(>\nBASU HOUSE\nFAX : 00-91-33-2212 7476 G.

Basis for Opinion 3. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Statement section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ('the ICAI') together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial results under the provisions of the Act and the rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Statement 4. This Statement has been prepared on the basis of the standalone annual financial statements and has been approved by the Company's Board of Directors.

In preparing the Statement, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 6. The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Statement 7. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this Statement. 8. As part of an audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Statement, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has in place an adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and the operating effectiveness of such controls. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management. Conclude on the appropriateness of the management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Statement or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Statement, including the disclosures, and whether the Statement represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 9. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Under section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls system with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report, hlowever, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its joint venture to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Statement, including the disclosures, and whether the Statement represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial statements/ financial information of the entities within the Group, and its joint venture, to express an opinion on the Statement.

In preparing the Statement, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 6. The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Statement 7. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this Statement. 8. As part of an audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Statement, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has in place an adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and the operating effectiveness of such controls. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management. Conclude on the appropriateness of the management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Statement or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Statement, including the disclosures, and whether the Statement represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 9. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
