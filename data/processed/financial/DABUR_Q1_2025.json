A\nreview of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons\nresponsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review\nprocedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with\nthe Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does\nnot enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that\nmight be identified in an audit.

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited consolidated financial results ('the Statement') of Dabur India Limited ('the Holding Company') and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as 'the Group') and its joint venture (refer Annexure 1 for the list of subsidiaries and joint venture included in the Statement) for the quarter ended 30 June 2024, being submitted by the Holding Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. 2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company's management and approved by the hlolding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting ('Ind AS 34'), prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act'), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review. 3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. We also performed procedures in accordance with the SEBI Circular CIR/CFD/CMD1/44/2019 dated 29 March 2019 issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33 (8) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), to the extent applicable. 4. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under section 133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results ('the Statement') of Dabur India Limited ('the Company') for the quarter ended 30 June 2024, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. 2. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's management and approved by the Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting ('Ind AS 34'), prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act'), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review. 3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under section 133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. We also performed procedures in accordance with the SEBI Circular CIR/CFD/CMD1/44/2019 dated 29 March 2019 issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33 (8) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), to the extent applicable. 4. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under section 133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
