We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the\nAct. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit\nof the Statement section of our report. We are independent of the Group, its associate companies and a joint\nventure company, in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India\n(‘the ICAI’) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial results\nunder the provisions of the Act, and the rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities\nin accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by\nus together with the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in\nparagraph 12 of the Other Matters section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Statement\n4. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company’s management and has been approved by\nthe Holding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared on the basis of the consolidated annual financial\nstatements. The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the\nStatement that gives a true and fair view of the consolidated net profit or loss and other comprehensive income,\nand other financial information of the Group including its associate companies and a joint venture company in\naccordance with the Ind AS prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting\nStandards) Rules, 2015 and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with\nRegulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is also responsible for\nensuring accuracy of records including financial information considered necessary for the preparation of the\nStatement. Further, in terms of the provisions of the Act, the respective Board of Directors of the Companies\nincluded in the Group and its associate companies and a joint venture company, covered under the Act, are\nresponsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act, for\nsafeguarding of the assets of the Group, and its associate companies and a joint venture company, and for\npreventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting\npolicies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and\nmaintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively, for ensuring the accuracy\nand completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial results,\nthat give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. These\nfinancial results have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Statement by the Directors of the Holding\nCompany, as aforesaid.\n5. In preparing the Statement, the respective Board of Directors/ the Management of the companies included in the\nGroup and of its associate companies and a joint venture company, are responsible for assessing the ability of\nthe Group and of its associate companies and a joint venture company, to continue as a going concern,\ndisclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting,\nunless the respective Board of Directors/ the Management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease\noperations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n6. Those respective Board of Directors/ the management of the Companies included in the Group and of its\nassociate companies and a joint venture company are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting\nprocess of the companies included in the Group and of its associate companies and a joint venture company.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Statement\n7. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement as a whole is free from material\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance\nwith Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act will always detect a material misstatement,\nwhen it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error, and are considered material if, individually, or in the\naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis\nof this Statement.\nChartered Accountants\n8. As part of an audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, we\nexercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Statement:\n(i) presents standalone annual financial results in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the\nListing Regulations; and\n(ii) gives a true and fair view in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the\napplicable Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) specified under Section 133 of the Companies\nAct, 2013 (‘the Act’), read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, and other\naccounting principles generally accepted in India, of the standalone net profit after tax and other\ncomprehensive loss and other financial information of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2025.\nBasis for Opinion\n3. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the\nAct. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the\nAudit of the Statement section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code\nof Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘the ICAI’) together with the ethical\nrequirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone annual financial results under the provisions of the\nAct and the rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these\nrequirements and the Code of Ethics.

This Statement has been prepared on the basis of the standalone annual financial statements and has been\napproved by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the\npreparation and presentation of the Statement that gives a true and fair view of the net profit and other\ncomprehensive loss and other financial information of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS specified\nunder Section 133 of the Act, read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and other\naccounting principles generally accepted in India, and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing\nRegulations. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance\nwith the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting\nfrauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making\njudgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of\nadequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Statement that\ngives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n5. In preparing the Statement, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going\nconcern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease\noperations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n6. The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Statement\n7. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement as a whole is free from\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our\nopinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted\nin accordance with Standards on Auditing, specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, will always detect a\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material\nif, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of\nusers taken on the basis of this Statement.\n8. As part of an audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing, specified under Section 143(10) of the Act,\nwe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Statement, whether due to fraud or error,\ndesign and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is\nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material\nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve\ncollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that\nare appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for\nexpressing our opinion on whether the Company has in place an adequate internal financial controls with\nreference to financial statements and the operating effectiveness of such controls;\n Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting\nestimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors;\n Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting\nand, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to\nthe related disclosures in the Statement or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.\nOur conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However,\nfuture events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern; and\nChartered Accountants\n Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Statement, including the disclosures, and\nwhether the Statement represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair\npresentation.\n9.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Statement section of our report. We are independent of the Group, its associate companies and a joint venture company, in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘the ICAI’) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial results under the provisions of the Act, and the rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us together with the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in paragraph 12 of the Other Matters section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Statement 4. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company’s management and has been approved by the Holding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared on the basis of the consolidated annual financial statements. The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Statement that gives a true and fair view of the consolidated net profit or loss and other comprehensive income, and other financial information of the Group including its associate companies and a joint venture company in accordance with the Ind AS prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is also responsible for ensuring accuracy of records including financial information considered necessary for the preparation of the Statement. Further, in terms of the provisions of the Act, the respective Board of Directors of the Companies included in the Group and its associate companies and a joint venture company, covered under the Act, are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act, for safeguarding of the assets of the Group, and its associate companies and a joint venture company, and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively, for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial results, that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. These financial results have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Statement by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. 5. In preparing the Statement, the respective Board of Directors/ the Management of the companies included in the Group and of its associate companies and a joint venture company, are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its associate companies and a joint venture company, to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the respective Board of Directors/ the Management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 6. Those respective Board of Directors/ the management of the Companies included in the Group and of its associate companies and a joint venture company are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the companies included in the Group and of its associate companies and a joint venture company. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Statement 7. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act will always detect a material misstatement, when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error, and are considered material if, individually, or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this Statement. Chartered Accountants 8. As part of an audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Statement, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls;  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors;  Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associate companies and a joint venture company, to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Statement or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associate companies and a joint venture company to cease to continue as a going concern;  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Statement, including the disclosures, and whether the Statement represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial results/ financial information/ financial statements of the entities within the Group, and its associate companies and a joint venture company, to express an opinion on the Statement. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of financial information/financial statements of such entities included in the Statement, of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the Statement, which have been audited by the other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 9. We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the Statement, of which we are the independent auditors, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 10. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 11. We also performed procedures in accordance with circular issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33 (8) of the Listing Regulations, to the extent applicable. Chartered Accountants Other Matters 12.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Statement or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern; and Chartered Accountants  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Statement, including the disclosures, and whether the Statement represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 9.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Statement section of our report. We are independent of the Group, its associate companies and a joint venture company, in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘the ICAI’) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial results under the provisions of the Act, and the rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us together with the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in paragraph 12 of the Other Matters section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Statement 4. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company’s management and has been approved by the Holding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared on the basis of the consolidated annual financial statements. The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Statement that gives a true and fair view of the consolidated net profit or loss and other comprehensive income, and other financial information of the Group including its associate companies and a joint venture company in accordance with the Ind AS prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is also responsible for ensuring accuracy of records including financial information considered necessary for the preparation of the Statement. Further, in terms of the provisions of the Act, the respective Board of Directors of the Companies included in the Group and its associate companies and a joint venture company, covered under the Act, are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act, for safeguarding of the assets of the Group, and its associate companies and a joint venture company, and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively, for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial results, that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. These financial results have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Statement by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. 5. In preparing the Statement, the respective Board of Directors/ the Management of the companies included in the Group and of its associate companies and a joint venture company, are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its associate companies and a joint venture company, to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the respective Board of Directors/ the Management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 6. Those respective Board of Directors/ the management of the Companies included in the Group and of its associate companies and a joint venture company are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the companies included in the Group and of its associate companies and a joint venture company. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Statement 7. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act will always detect a material misstatement, when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error, and are considered material if, individually, or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this Statement. Chartered Accountants 8. As part of an audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Statement, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls;  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors;  Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associate companies and a joint venture company, to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Statement or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associate companies and a joint venture company to cease to continue as a going concern;  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Statement, including the disclosures, and whether the Statement represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial results/ financial information/ financial statements of the entities within the Group, and its associate companies and a joint venture company, to express an opinion on the Statement. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of financial information/financial statements of such entities included in the Statement, of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the Statement, which have been audited by the other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 9. We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the Statement, of which we are the independent auditors, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 10. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 11. We also performed procedures in accordance with circular issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33 (8) of the Listing Regulations, to the extent applicable. Chartered Accountants Other Matters 12.

These annual financial statements have been audited by other auditors whose audit reports have been furnished to us by the management, and our opinion in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries is based solely on the audit reports of such other auditors and the procedures performed by us as stated in paragraph 11 above. Further, these subsidiaries are located outside India, whose annual financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in their respective countries, and which have been audited by other auditors under generally accepted auditing standards applicable in their respective countries.

Basis for Opinion 3. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Statement section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘the ICAI’) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone annual financial results under the provisions of the Act and the rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics.

In preparing the Statement, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 6. The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Statement 7. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing, specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this Statement. 8. As part of an audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing, specified under Section 143(10) of the Act, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Statement, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has in place an adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and the operating effectiveness of such controls;  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors;  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Statement or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern; and Chartered Accountants  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Statement, including the disclosures, and whether the Statement represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 9. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 10. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
