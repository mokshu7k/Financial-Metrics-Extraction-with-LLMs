Moving on to Slide number 5. So if you were to look at our distribution, we are now at about 26.7 lakh outlets in total. Our focus state growth has been much higher than our growth for the rest of India. So focus states have continued to grow at a faster clip, which is 2.2x what we've grown in the rest of India.

It's a product which is much better than a heat- treated product. And we've also launched rich milkshakes and coconut water this season. And we've had very high double-digit growth as far as drinks are concerned. And our innovation contribution has been greater than 10%.

Arnab Mitra: My first question was, again, actually, on margins. So you mentioned you probably need to take some more price corrections. And our understanding is there is a bit of a sequential up move we are seeing in edible oil, sugar, and possibly even in wheat flour. So in this environment, do you not feel that there could be more pressure in margins in the near term? Or are there other ways you could offset this situation? Varun Berry: No. So see, edible oil, there is no uptick. Edible oils actually are at the lowest ever in the last 3, 4 years. Sugar, yes, there has been a little bit of inflation, but I think the government is very clear that they want to control this. So I don't think",

And while the inflation currently is low single digits, but we've got to watch that. But at this point in time, it seems we are covered for the next 3 or 4 months. So we just have to make sure that we do this carefully. And obviously, we are doing things in a way that they are reversible at short notice. So we don't see a risk. But if there is a risk that emerges, we will be able to make sure that we mitigate that very quickly. Arnab Mitra: Okay. The other thing I wanted to ask was on employee costs and depreciation. This seems in the stand-alone and consul both. It seems to have stepped up Y-o-Y as well as sequentially. Is this largely due to new capacities? And do we see this going up further as more capacities probably are in line for getting commissioned or ramping up? Varun Berry: See, you will see some increase",

N. Venkataraman: Yes. No, absolutely right. So the increase in depreciation is on account of some of these units, which have come up, dairy, UP, terminate, etcetera. It's also the increase in employee cost that you see is partially on account of that plus on account of the increments that have happened in the current financial year. So like Varun said, what really happens is that while some of these lines see an increase, there is a reduction that happens in the conversion cost, which goes as part of the other expenses.  Britannia Industries Limited August 07, 2023 So we have been tracking that quite closely to ensure that overall, we stand to gain.

So if I look at FY '23, that number was up more than 50%, which is much higher compared to what the industry was doing. How are you looking at the number in FY '24 with increased competition, would you look to raise it, or with moderation in revenue growth, you would want to reduce it? Varun Berry: Can you repeat the question? Kunal Vora: Yes.

So we had just normalized our spend. It was not like we had gone completely out of whack. We had normalized our spend after those 2 or 3 years of COVID. And that's why you're seeing the increase. I think we will remain within these parameters. It's not like we are looking at taking this completely out of the charts. We will remain within those parameters as far as these spends are concerned. Kunal Vora: Where you were at 400 to 500 in the earlier years, it went to which is a sizable jump. So would you remain closer to 75% or go back to the 500 levels which you had earlier?

So unless volumes pick up substantially, my guess is that top- line growth could look like 0, with whatever volume growth being there, getting offset by the negative pricing. This is on top line and on profits. Your H2 last year gross margin, as well as EBITDA margins, were already pretty rich at 18% to 19%, even if I were to strip out the bunched-up PLI from the equation, grateful if you can comment on this, if there's something I'm missing or if you would like to throw some light on what ways are there to prop up value growth and margin as the quarters progress?

So things are looking a little better, still not out of the woods completely, but definitely better than what -- where we were. Going to the next slide, the performance scorecard for Britannia. We did -- our revenue from operations were INR4,130 crores, which was a 4% growth on a 12-month basis and a 13% growth on a 24-month basis. Our operating profit was at 16.5%, which was at a 10% growth on a 12-month basis and a 51% growth on a 24-month basis. So I would say good results in the current environment.

Our uptick in rural distribution, we've gone up to 30,000 rural distributors. And if you look at our rural performance, it's a better performance than what it is for urban, which is good. As we've seen,  Britannia Industries Limited August 05, 2024 there's a little revival in the rural economy as well.

So I noticed that you have mentioned on profitable growth. My specific question is, do you need to work further on the pricing aspect? Because I remember few quarters back you had said the pricing premium is high for Britannia in cheese and you would like to reduce that. Where are we in terms of that? Second is, would you have a market share in cheese, because really that opportunity is very high given the kind of technology you bring to the table, the huge facility you have now, any numbers you can share with us directionally, how you see market share next year in cheese?

Correct me if I am wrong. And do you see that, any incremental changes here going ahead? Does this anniversarize very quickly? Or do you expect some more deflation in the coming quarters to continue? Varun Berry: No, there is no deflation really. What -- I think what you are alluding to is the fact that we have taken price rollbacks. So, basically, if you look at it, our rollbacks have been on for some time now, but now is the time to start to consolidate. We've done what we had to. There might be a few promotions here and there, but as far as rollbacks are concerned, we've done what we have to. As we were saying, we expect 4% to 5%",

Question is on focus market. Things you have been emphasizing a lot in your focus market and which is growing much faster than the company's overall growth. And I also do understand that the growth is mainly driven by the distribution, expansion or investment behind the brand building. So my question is how much there is a still gap between you and number one player in the focus market in terms of market share now versus three years back? Second, what was the key learning for you from your focus market and those success you wanted to replicate in your weak market? So when I say weak market, I mean where you are number two or number three player. And third and last question is what percentage of revenue is coming from your focus market, because that will give us some little direction from the future growth",

Varun Berry: It's a very loaded question with many sub-questions in it. I'll try and answer it as much as I can. So our focus market performance has not been great. Let me put it straight across. I had expected a much better performance there. And the reason for that is that the rural markets are still coming out of that phase where rural was lagging urban. And there's a little bit of downtrading happening in some of the markets as well, where people are going to the lowest common denominator and the cheapest product in the markets. So, our performance this quarter, as far as the Hindi belt is concerned, has been average, I would say, and the endeavor will be to take it to above average as we move forward.

As you've seen, we've been gaining about one share point a year for the past eight years, 10 years. So we are now at about, let's say, close to 18% share.

And in this quarter, nominal growth is at 8%, out of which the inflation number is only at 0.2%. So things are coming back to normal, as you'll notice that full year '21, '22 and '22, '23 were at a very high number, as far as inflation was concerned. Moving on to the next slide. This gives an idea of where we play in and what is the total market that we are playing in. So if you look at the categories that Britannia plays in, it's about INR 1,00,000 crores, and the 5-year CAGR for this category has been 11%. If you look at the total branded F&B category, that is at INR 9,00,000 crores with a 5-year CAGR of 12%. The total F&B is at INR 40,00,000 crores, which has got a 5-year CAGR of 11%.

And the biscuit consumption occasions during the year, they used to be at 303 in 2018; and those have gone up to 370 in 2023, so overall looking good. If you look at the next slide, which is a very interesting slide. Basically what's happening is that we are getting to a situation of nuclear families, so size of the family is reducing. The number of women who are participating in the workforce is going up. And as a result of that, there is a need for packaged food and convenience; and that's why the growth that we are seeing, as far as  Britannia Industries Limited November 02, 2023 branded F&B is concerned.

Urban as a percentage or as a contribution to the overall economy has been growing. It's gone up. Let's say if you were to take -- in the last 2 or 3 years, it's gone up pretty substantially. And so that's good for us because we have predominantly been urban distributed, a stronger urban company. However, for us the growths in the last, let's say, 10 years have been much faster in rural because we've been gaining more distribution and making our presence felt in more villages and smaller towns. So our -- if you look at the bars on the right. Our market share currently is also more urban centric. Our market share is heavier in -- is 1.3x what it is in rural, in urban.

So if you look at biscuits, we have a penetration in households of about 94%. So biscuits, bread and rusk has pretty high penetration ranging from 82% to 94%, so there it's going to be a consumption-led growth that we are looking at. And the reason for the same is that, one, as far as biscuits is concerned, per capita consumption in India is only about 2 kilos. And if you were to factor in the number of consumption occasions, which has gone up from 303 to 370 per annum, the number of biscuits that are consumed is just about 1 biscuit per occasion. And that can definitely go up, so it's going to be a consumption-led growth here. And if you were to look at it by categories. While there are",

This has gone up to 27.3 lakh in September of 2023. Our total distribution has gone up from 54 lakhs to 66 lakhs, but as you'll notice, bulk of this growth has come from direct distribution.

And they get into a very, very -- a variety of categories. What we've stayed true to is to make sure that we move in concentric circles.

Britannia Industries Limited November 02, 2023 We have -- we are looking at some of the other categories as well, but we are staying close to the knitting so that we don't go too far from where our strength lies.

Firstly, if you could give the volume growth or decline for this quarter; and secondly, if you could explain the big Q-o-Q drop in the employee cost, that will be very helpful. And my main question is on the growth. So the poor growth that we have seen this quarter, could you break the reasons up into two or three parts? So one is that there is a high base. Second is there is a general FMCG demand weakness. Third is that there is this local and regional competition which is getting active. So if these three reasons put together were, let's say, 100, what part of that 100 would you allocate to each of them? Varun Berry: That's a very complicated question, Percy.

What was your third question? You'll have to rephrase it, 100 and all of that. I didn't understand... Percy Panthaki: Okay, fine. What I wanted to understand is that there are, as I can see, 3 reasons why the growth is weak. One is that there is a high base effect. Second is that there is a general FMCG weakness.

    "content": "It's been a very tough environment. As all of you know, you've been through many conference calls, and I think the common theme that's coming through is that it's a tough demand scenario, coupled with high inflation. So just a few numbers here. So if you look at what's happened to rural and urban, we've seen FMCG value growth percentages go down over the quarters and inflation on the right-hand side is sort of moving upwards. The CPI has moved up to 5.5% and the food inflation is up to 9.2%. So it's an environment which we'll have to maneuver our way through. It's a tough environment, always a sine curve on inflation. There was deflation about 7, 8 months ago, and now there's high inflation. So it's a tough environment. We'll have to maneuver our ways through it. Moving to the next Slide, you will see that the FMCG market growth, as given by NIQ, are lowest in metro. In metros, if you look at it, they were almost at 0%. And today, they stand at about 2%. We have a hypothesis on that.",

So metros are the ones where the slowdown is the maximum and let's try and understand why. Now this is only a hypothesis, so excuse us if you've already studied this. But moving on to the next Slide, what this clearly shows is that, if you were to look at the CPI basket weight for rural and urban, one thing that comes through very clearly is the housing cost. The housing cost in urban and especially in metro areas is about 22% of the total CPI basket weight. And we know that Real Estate is -- the prices have gone up, the rentals have gone up, and that's creating stress for most consumers in large cities and metros.  Britannia Industries Limited November 12, 2024 On the right-hand side is a reflection of what's really happening on the salaries front. So let me explain this chart to you. So this -- the first bar that you",

If they are non-salaried, what they have seen as their nominal increase in earnings over the last 12 months is 3.4%, while the salaried class have -- their earnings have gone up by about 6.5%. So there's stress in almost 51% of the workforce sitting in urban areas. So that is the double whammy, which is creating a demand shortfall as far as urban and especially metros is concerned. Moving on to the next Slide. Our share -- this is a share Slide that we share with you every time. Our share has been flattish. In fact, the first half, we have been flat over the last year. However, the -- in conditions like this where there's deflation and then inflation alternately, I think we are in a good place because being the market leaders, the onus of taking price increases is always on us to make sure that we show the",

So driving efficiencies in distribution, our journey continues. We are expanding direct reach. We are now at 28.5 lakh outlets that we cover directly. There is an uptick in rural distribution where we've -- our number of distributors is now over 30,000, the rural distributors. Our focus states are performing better. They're about 1.9x what rest of India is. It's not much, frankly, if you ask me, I'm not satisfied with this because rest of India is also low and so is focus states. But growth will come back.

So there's a 45% increase. However, we had some strategic covers. So it's not showing in our graph.

The first question is from the line of Abneesh Roy from Nuvama Wealth. Abneesh Roy: My first question is on the volume growth. So last 3 quarters, we have seen good volume growth from you in the range of 7% to 8%. So my question is, how do you see in terms of outlook next few quarters, given base is high? Second, there is a good inflation in many of your raw materials and at INR5, INR10 you'll have to cut grammage to pass on. So that also means that, that will have an adverse impact on the volume growth. So would you say that now it will be a healthy mix of pricing and volume? So -- plus there could be some down trading impact, right? You did speak on the urban and very good Slides, I'll say. It has really made us understand the urban slowdown a bit better.

If you can firstly jog our memory, is there any difference in margin profiles in second quarter versus the earlier quarters? Are they usually weaker on the gross margin level? Should one expect margins to bounce back to the historical levels given the price hikes of 4% to 5% that you have already put into the market? Varun Berry: So for sure, the price hikes will make the margins better. But as I said on the commodity side, the inflation is also a lot bigger than what we had expected. And we had some strategic buys, which will probably continue for some more months from our strategic buys. But the inflation is genuinely reasonably high. So we expect to maintain margins rather than increase margins, balance inflation and make sure that we are able to keep a stable margin profile.

The first slide, I think you've seen it many times over. Basically, it just talks about the economy in the country doing very well. It's the private consumption, which is slower than what it was last year. The investment in capital, etcetera, has gone up considerably. And I think it's a matter of time before private consumption comes back to an even keel as well. Moving on to the next slide, which is our performance scorecard. So if you look at our revenue from operations for Q3 '24, it's at INR 4,192 crores with the operating profit of 17.7%. And our revenue from operations on a 12-months basis has grown by 2%, and operating profit is negative 2%. While if you look at a 24-months base, our CAGR is -- growth is 19% on a 24-months basis. And on the operating profit front, the growth is at 52%. The next slide is about the market share. This is a slide that",

So I'll take you through these. So as far as distribution is concerned, we've expanded direct reach to 27.6 lakh outlets. We've also increased our rural distribution by appointing 29,000 rural distributors, which has gone up from 28,000 in December '22. And our focus states continue. As you'll all notice that our overall growth is small, but the growth for the focused states is much more than what it is for the country. The next slide is about pricing actions that we've taken.

So to make sure that we don't continue with the same prices but bring them down in line with what the inflation of raw materials is, we've taken certain strategic pricing actions in some of our key brands. And we've also done some tactical consumer promotions to drive consumption on those products because we've seen that as far as consumption trends, especially in rural are concerned, we seem to be not doing as well as we were in the previous years. We've also had -- on the next slide, please. We've also had a sustained marketing support to drive consumer engagement and some very exciting promotions, which have been done.

We've delivered cost efficiencies across our functions. Outlook will be to closely monitor stock price situation of commodities because there's been high volatility in the last two or three years. We remain vigilant on the competitive pricing actions thereof as a result of the commodity inflation. Our strategy will remain focused on driving market share.

So I would actually say that aspiration is to get to -- get back to double-digit volume growth soon. And I think it will take a little bit of time. I don't think it's going to happen in the next quarter or so, but we are moving towards that. And clearly, there seems to be consumption coming back. Obviously, the economy and the stock markets and all of that seems to be moving in the right direction. There's no way that consumption is going to lag so much.

We will bring all the products which we feel have a right to succeed with the Indian population. So we are going to create the habit as well.

Yes, our contribution from adjacent businesses has to grow much faster than base business. And that's -- I think we got stymy during COVID because adjacent businesses are more on the go, and it's sort of got us off track. But now on, we are committed to make sure that we grow our adjacent businesses at a much faster clip. I would say, at least 50% higher than what we grow our base business, which is biscuits.

The pace of growth as far as distribution, see as you go higher, you tend to have less opportunity for growth, but I would not say so. I do think that we have still a large opportunity for growth. But the focus has been on getting more depth of distribution in our outlets, getting more SKUs in our outlets while we've continued to grow our direct reach as well.

Moving to the next slide, which is the challenge that I was referring to, it's been an extraordinarily high inflationary environment. If you look at the CFPI, which is the food inflation, it was almost at double digits in this quarter. And if you were to look at some of the key food -- so if you were to look at cereals, it was about 6.5%, Oils and fats was almost at about 15%, and similarly, vegetables and fruits and everything was pretty high single digits or double digits. Our inflation for the block of commodities that we buy, for us was approximately 11% with the RPO being -- and I'll come to the details in a bit, but RPO and Cocoa were leading this inflation.

Basically, what the government is projecting is that the agriculture, livestock, forestry and fishing is going to go up from the first half being at 7.5% to almost 12% in the second half of the year. And similarly, manufacturing  Britannia Industries Limited February 07, 2025 going up from 5.5% to 7.5%, which is going to lead the recovery as far as the GDP growths are concerned. The bottom slide just takes us into a little more detail, so I will not drain that slide.

We've been going through a phase, which is a phase of inflation, deflation, inflation, deflation. So towards the beginning of the year, it seemed that the environment is not going to be inflationary. And we have taken pretty steep price increases towards the last year. So we started to correct, and as we were doing that, there was a huge inflation which came at us. And we have now started to take the price increases. So if you were to look at our revenue growth and our volume growth, they are almost at par, which shows that we have not taken any price increase till now. But as we speak, we've taken -- we've started to take price increases, which are going to make sure that we are able to take this in our stride. Now this slide is about market shares. We've had a flattish market share year, and that's predominantly because of the ups and downs that we've seen in our prices. And once this moves",

We have moved from March '24 of 27.9 lakh outlets to 28.8 lakh outlets. And even our rural distributors have moved up from 30,000 to 31,000. Our focus states are doing much better than rest of India, that continues to be our growth engine. The next slide is on our route-to-market. So the route-to-market has 2 elements to it: one is how do we deal with the emerging channels; and second is, what do we do to urban retail, which is our large cities and the retail distribution, the up and down the street accounts that we have, how do we get them to grow at a faster pace because these are the accounts which are also challenged by the emerging channels.

There are actually 5 parts to this. One is, how do we leverage high-potential outlets and service them in the way that we would want to. There are some outlets which require higher service frequency. There are some outlets which do not deserve the kind of frequency they get. So how do we right- size the service frequency for these outlets.

Moving on to the next slide, which is about the sustained investments in brand. Now what we focused on is critical growth brands and innovation. And what we've also done is we've done some higher-impact social media activations so that they can bring better productivity to our advertising efforts.

This is, again, an engine which is working really, really well. We've been presenting this to you forever, but let me just reinforce this one more time. The elements of our cost savings are on the left-hand side. So again, you can see what are the elements that we focus on. In 2013-'14, it used to be 0.7% of our revenue. And in this year, it's going to be 2.5% of our revenue. We've scaled it up deliberately, obviously, because of the inflationary trends that we are seeing.

As I was saying, for flour, there has been a 4% inflation, but this 4% would have been higher had we not had the forward buying that we've done on flour. Palm has been a 43% inflation and that, too, despite our forward buying. So palm has been -- palm oil has been a very, very high inflation. Sugar is flat. Cocoa is at 103% inflation.

These states are like we keep saying these are opportunity states because that's where the biscuit consuming population is, and we have got a market share which is underleveraged, and therefore, there is a lot of headspace. And like Varun said, I think the backbone that we want to build in these states is distribution- led, right, and brand-led. And that's the impetus that we've been able to put forward, which is giving us this kind of growth, right. So the other very important aspect of these states is that they are almost 35%",

So if you look at it, our revenue from operations for this year, INR16,546 crores, which is a 4% growth from a revenue perspective if you look at it from a 1-year perspective and a 19% growth from a 24- month perspective. Operating profit is a very healthy 17.3%, which is growing at 10% on a 1- year perspective and 43% on a 2-year perspective.

We are at north of 90%, which is best-in-class, both in modern trade as well as e-commerce. In some of the accounts, we are at service level, which is in excess of 93%.

We split the salesman. This was done in 2014 and '15 in the top outlets, in the top cities, we split salesmen. We got an extra salesman to sell a separate set of brands and SKUs, and that has been giving us pretty good results from then onwards. The objective of Route to Market 2.0, which is starting off. Actually, we've just kicked off the process, is to make sure that we multiply adjacent business revenues, while continuing to grow our core and building it even further. So the points really are we are trying to rewrite our outlet segmentation to focus on the high- pot outlets. We will align service architecture to service these high-potential outlets, obviously, by increasing the feet on street with a split portfolio. And this time, we are not going to restrict ourselves to 2 salesmen. If there is a requirement in",

We have been growing volumes, and I think our outlook on this year is not deflationary. Our outlook on this year is slightly inflationary, which is a healthy inflation of 3% or thereabouts.

This, I would believe, is much lower than where we want it to be. And third is the focus around the adjacent portfolio. So how should we think of margins on that aspect, especially over the next 12 months or so? Varun Berry: So our target for the entire set of NPDs is north of 3.5%. So this, we've spoken about the NPDs that we put on that slide. So we will continue with that target of 3.5% of overall revenue as far as the NPDs are concerned. As far as margins are concerned, see, the way we look at it is that this year is a year of top line growth. And if it means taking a short-term hit on margins because of all the projects, because of all that we are doing, we will be willing to do that, but it's not going to be dramatically different from where we are at.

Over to Mr. Berry with the remarks on the performance. Varun Berry: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. So, without much ado, let me jump into the presentation.

So we are hoping that these are clear signs of recovery of the slowdown that we’d seen in the FMCG industry. On that positive note, let me move on to our performance scorecard. So in this quarter, we've seen a turnover of INR 4,376 crores, which was on a 12-month growth basis was a 9% growth; and if you look at a 2-year number, it's a 12.4% growth. And profit after tax, we've seen 12.8% of revenue for the fourth quarter, which is a 4% growth on a 12-month basis and a little flattish on the 24-month basis. Moving on to the next slide, which is the revenue from operations. The revenue from operations for the full year was INR 17,535 crores, which was a 6% growth on a 12-month basis and about a 10% growth on a 2-year basis. Profit after tax was again 12.5% of revenue, which was a 3% growth year-on-year",

Now getting to our strategic pillars, which you are well aware of, but just reiterating those - distribution and marketing, innovation, adjacent business growth, cost efficiencies and sustainability, and I'll cover these one-by-one. So on distribution, we've made good progress. So if you look at March '24 to March '25, our total direct reach has gone up from 27.9 lakhs outlets to 28.7 lakhs outlets. And even our rural distributors have gone up from 30,000 to 31,000.  Britannia Industries Limited May 12, 2025 We've also -- next slide, we've also leveraged the new channels, e-com namely. The e-com growth has been seven-and-half times of what it is in other channels. And we've had some e- com only or e-com first launches. So Pure Magic Frames was one such launch, which was extremely successful. This was -- the theme was the Harry Potter theme, and we saw some very good results, just launching it with the e-com and quick-com channels. Moving on, we",

And this biscuit was sized and etched with Avani's gold winning targets. So that was a very exciting campaign that we did. The second one was during the Mahakumbh, we had -- Good Day tied up with Chai Point, which gave us good mileage in that very large event in the country. We also have had some very exciting innovations in adjacencies. We've launched Winkin' Cow Grow, which is a very exciting product at a very attractive price, and that's doing quite well. It's just been 2 months, but we are seeing great traction on that product. We've also re-launched cheese just about 2 months ago.

Croissant has been a very good growth for us, high double-digit growth, which is 3 times that we are seeing on biscuits. And similarly on wafers, wafers has been a very, very good growth for us as well. Cake, I have already spoken about, and that's giving us very good traction. Rusk, again, we re-launched it with a new pack design and which is just about a month back. In fact, the products are just hitting the market as we speak.

We've started to see very good growth in some of these markets and also the profitability has come back. As far as cost leadership is concerned, this program is, again, firing very well for us. Our target was to get to 8x of what we started within 2013-14. But this year, we went on overdrive because inflation had become pretty high, and we thought that we could do with some additional cost efficiencies and savings. So we've been able to achieve more than that. So '24- '25 has been 9x of what we started within 2013-'14. So it's been a very good year for us, almost 2.5% of our overall revenue.

We've got some recognitions for what we've done, and these are all listed on the right side of the slide. I'm not going to belabor those recognitions.

Cocoa was flattish sequential or slightly down sequentially, but year-on-year was 83% inflation, and we are all aware of the cocoa story. Laminates was fine. It was a small inflation from a year-on-year basis. Milk again was 11% sequential and a 21% inflation from a year-on-year basis. So this clearly is a story where there was a pretty aggressive inflation and which necessitated us taking some action on the pricing front, and that's what we did, which kept our profits in good shape. Now from a cost and profitability front, price actions I've already spoken about. Cost savings I've already spoken about.

From an outlook perspective, we obviously are very closely monitoring which way the commodity prices move. We are going through the phase when the new season wheat comes in. And we're not very clear at this stage whether the inflation is going to be as far as wheat is concerned, but we are closely monitoring that and similarly, other commodities as well. And we are also very vigilant about the fact that we've taken pricing and making sure that we are not priced out of the market. It seems that inflation is hurting everyone. So it seems to be moving in the right direction. The focus will remain on sustaining margins and also at the same time, remaining competitive. Next slide is about our revenue trends.

Very happy to answer your questions now. Moderator: First question comes from the line of Abneesh Kumar Roy with Nuvama. Abneesh Roy: Congrats on good performance. I have 3 questions. My first question is on the demand side. You have seen a 7-quarter high sales growth this quarter. Was there a significant impact of Kumbh Mela? Coca-Cola saw 18 crores servings being sold in Q4 in Kumbh Mela and your product also has very high demand in such demand scenario. So that was one bit on demand. Second is on the outlook, you said clear signs of recovery. And this quarter, almost every FMCG company has said. Issue is last 2 years, FMCG has seen many false starts. So what will be your confidence level in terms of recovery in FY '26? That is the first question. Varun Berry: Okay. So Abneesh, we -- because we are so",

I don't think it's going to happen -- It's not going to be a hockey stick. But I do think that there is -- we have seen gradual recovery, and I do think that this trend is going to continue into the next year as well. Abneesh Roy: My second question is on the competitive intensity. So this time, the market share chart seems to be missing. So if you could tell us any reasons for that. Second is a lot of FMCG categories, there is a competition from D2C. We have seen some level of impact on beauty, personal care from D2C companies.

So if you could tell us how has it lived up to initial expectation? And can the trajectory change to a higher level in the next 2, 3 years? Varun Berry: No -- So absolutely, Abneesh. So yes, you're right -- I talk more positively about all of the other categories, including cake now after the re-launch. The growths are now pretty solid. Cheese, what's happened after the re-launch, as you're rightly saying, the pricing -- so there are some players who don't have a distribution system, right -- So",

But having said that, we are hoping to see healthy growth, both volume as well as revenue. Mihir Shah: Got it, sir. So secondly, how should one think about pricing from here on?

And in the light of whatever pricing you have taken, I'm sure some pricing will flow in more in the second -- in the next few quarters. How much of price growth do you expect at this stage for FY '26? Varun Berry: So the delta is about 5.5% between pricing and -- between revenue and volume.

Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us today for the results call of Quarter 1 Financial Year 24. During Quarter 1 Financial Year ‘24, most of the economies witnessed a moderation in inflation. In India too, inflation showed signs of easing, as witnessed in both CPI and WPI data. With this moderation in inflation, there has been an uptick in volumes in both urban and rural markets, indicating promising signs of recovery in demand. In such an environment, I am pleased to share with you that Q1 Financial Year ’24 has been a quarter of strong growth across all geographies. Dabur's consolidated revenue for the quarter crossed INR3,000 crores mark to close at INR 3,130 crores and",

And when seen from a gross margin to EBITDA margin kind of a translation, it is much higher than the gross margin expansion versus the other companies. So could you elaborate this recovery bit, is that sustainable for the coming quarters also across categories? Mohit Malhotra: Hi, Abneesh, so I think the recovery is seen in the market per se, it is not just Dabur recovery, if you have seen that, rural business across the board actually has recovered and there is a volume uptick, which is being seen in the rural business. So rural for the category itself or should I say for the FMCG market has actually grown by 4%. We are growing ahead in rural at around 8% and urban growth for us is around 10%. So, across all",

We are not taking mainstream and keeping it restricted to e-commerce till the time we establish a GTM for baby care. So with this advocacy team coming in and going to gynaecologists and paediatricians, Baby care will come into mainstream.

We were carrying a lot of inventory in e-commerce for healthcare and that inventory is getting depleted as we speak and Chyawanprash growth is still not back on track and Chyawanprash CAGR continues to be at 11% but still Chyawanprash is not growing as we would expect. Although it is a lower base for Chyawanprash, non-season for Chyawanprash but still the decline in Chyawanprash is to a tune of around 9% or so but this is not the season. In the season we expect Chawanprash to actually grow. It's not a depleted inventory. That's the point I'm trying to illustrate. It's a normal",

And the same supply chain handles it, same distribution handles it, same distributor handling it. So, I think it doesn't cost us much. The new variants bring in more vibrancy and a better incremental business. Similarly, real brand. A real brand is now available in a pet bottle. Earlier only a tetra pack was going.

So for us to grow ahead of the category, the volume growth should be ahead of a mid-single also. For us to gain market shares across 90% of the portfolio that we have. Latika Chopra: Sure. And my second question was on beverages.",

I understand the first quarter was sluggish, which is about 30% to 40% of the business. But for the remaining quarters, are you okay if we build in some growth or are you seeing any other challenges here? You know, of a high base or anything like that? Mohit Malhotra: See, we have taken a target of around 8% to 9% growth on a high base of 40% of last year. So, we are looking at that target for us. The season now played havoc for us, but the targeted growth is definitely that. And we see the month of July, 22 days out of total 30 days in July was impacted because of rains. So this is an extraordinary event that we are seeing which wasn't planned earlier. So I can't tell you guidance going forward for beverages because it is so much season driven for us.

Mohit Malhotra: Yes, so easier question first. The total capex is in the range of INR450 crores for the current year and that's what in the current quarter we have done INR160 crores of capex. So full year we should be doing around INR450 crores of capex. Now the second part of your question in terms of oral care, oral, the volume growth of the category is 2.5%. We have done a volume growth of roughly around 8% in Oralcare with Dabur Red as a flagship gaining 50 basis point market share. The category of natural which is 30% was 30% now has become 31%.

So that's also worked in our Favor. Latika Chopra: That SKUs… Mohit Malhotra: Yes toothpaste, I am talking.

In the previous fiscal year, we have corrected that problem in the quarter 1 and going forward, the business should trend well even in Reliance, I'm saying.

You seem to be sounding much more confident on rural recovery, but we are getting very mixed signals from most other management on rural side. So, what has changed for us and how, and you talked about the big single digit growth at the aggregate level on the volume side, but what is it that has specifically changed for us on the rural side and any specific markets which you would like to talk about? Mohit Malhotra: The way rural was, I am looking at the market indicators in FMCG volume. Rural used to be minus 5 in quarter 4 of 2022. From minus 5 volume, it became minus 2, then to minus 3, minus 3, then plus 0.3 and now plus 4. So, definitely these are trends of almost a recovery that one is actually seeing if one plots a graph.

MSP rates have also gone up. This will increase the money in the hands of the rural consumer. And while the category is growing at 4%, we have grown by 8% in rural. So, that is telling us that money is back in rural. And moreover, price increases have come down now and as we move into next quarter there the price increases will go down and volume growth will actually start. When the inflation was high, price increases were high, it was pinching the rural consumer and therefore their propensity to spend was impacted.

The shock of price increase is now in the base and that is a kind of a up trade. So, consumer has gotten used to it and now they are buying products.

Would you be a bit disappointed with the 15% growth even you could have gained from the distribution expansion? Plus in the international market, some of the market leaders had a quality issue. So can you gain in the international markets because of this from a medium-term perspective? Mohit Malhotra: Abneesh, apologies again for the delayed start. Yes, in Badshah, I think the performance has been reasonably good. We've been sustaining a good performance for over a couple of quarters now.

As far as the international bit of Badshah is concerned, we also faced a pushback from international regulators, especially in the U.K., there's been very tight screening and scrutiny of all the dispatches which are happening from India to international driven by the controversy which has happened. So while our products have not got picked up, but because of a very high scrutiny, there's a long queue and backup of the suppliers, which is lining up and leading to delays in the supply chain.

So I expect the subsequent quarters to be better than our existing quarters, but definitely not worse. Percy: Right. And I know it's a little difficult to answer the following question, but",

Mohit Malhotra: So I think as far as Dabur is concerned, if you look at the overall construct, our addressable market, total addressable market is only in the range of around 2% to 3% of the overall FMCG. So there are a lot of white spaces which are there in the portfolio, which is what we are trying to plug with innovation.

And because of which and for him to take market share, it has dropped the prices and made 250 ml available at INR10 due to which the market leader has also dropped the prices, due to which the number 2 player has also dropped the prices.

Or are you seeing changes from the unorganized sector or players to the organized players that change is coming back, which you were seeing a few quarters back.

New schemes being announced by the government. So I think all that is leading to a better sentiment and this better sentiment generally leads to better consumption. I can't tell you a very hard fact of correlating with the money in the hands of the consumers. But I think sentiment euphoria leads to better consumption, and that is what is, I think, happening in rural and the government has also come back in the third term.

We've not corrected inventory, hasn't corrected or taken a beating on the sales to correct the inventory. We are trying to drive secondary to correct the inventory. So our secondary sales has been higher than our primary sales. To that extent, the inventory levels of the stock actually depletes down.

So I anticipate volume growth going up and price growth to be muted in the tune of around 2% only. As far as health care is concerned, our price increase in the current quarter, a 6% price increase in the health care business. Our HPC business has a price element of around 1.4% to 1.5%. And food is actually all volume driven. So that is the way it will be going forward in the quarter because if there is inflation, which there is, as I see the inflation in food is very high today, so we might have to take some price increases in food, but it depends upon how the situation is. Our margins are holding up, and that's where we are, yes. Avi Mehta: Got it. Perfectly clear. And yes, I misunderstood your earlier comment.

In Namaste last update when we gave you and an update now, we've been able to achieve the corporate separateness in Namaste. So Dabur International & Dermoviva are not a part of the litigation now anymore. So only Namaste, which is less than 1% of our profit and turnover is in the ambit of the legal case. So that's a very good development happening in our favor. Number two, we've been negotiating the legal cost and the legal cost as compared to last year to the current year is substantially lower. So this quarter, we've only incurred INR18 crore of legal cost. In Q1 FY24, it was in the range of around INR25 crores, so substantially lower for the full year. We should be incurring a cost of around INR80 crores as compared to INR100 crores last year. So, I think overall, still the case is in the discovery stage, and we",

And if I look at historically, since FY '21, this segment has faced challenges post the COVID benefits that we had. How do we think I mean, for this year, since the base is favorable for Q3, would the slower growth you would attribute largely to the unfavorable seasonality or is there any structural change which is happening because we have taken price increase as well in this segment.

We also introduced Glucose in our drink segment, which also has done well for us. Our value-added Glucose is doing better. Vitamin C and other flavors are doing better than our regular glucose, which is also margin accretive. Our margins have substantially improved in the Glucose segment also. As far as Honey is concerned, we faced some concern on last winter. The winters were very acute and some part of Honey had actually crystallized in the marketplace. So we've taken back some stock. So therefore, the growth on honey wasn't there in our health supplement piece and even Chyawanprash due to the high heatwave it's not done so well in the current quarter but post our monsoon campaign in the month of June and July, we've seen good growth happening in Chyawanprash.

If the deflationary environment continues and we anticipate in the second quarter, the deflationary environment will be there, we'll have a flat sort of inflation that's the prediction that we got from our procurement function.

As far as GT is concerned, I don't think distribution has incrementally added to the growth which is happening. We are investing ahead of the curve as far as media is concerned. So South business has done well. Our market shares have improved over there. But in North India, there's a huge scope and Patanjali in particular State of UP, etc, has gained market share from us. So there's a lot of hard work which has to happen there on a INR10 price point and a INR20 price point to gain shares there, but we are investing.

Excluding the one-off exceptional legal costs, our operating profit grew by 16% and consolidated PAT increased by 14.1%. Overall, the demand scenario is improving. The onset of festive season augurs well for our business, and we will continue to drive profitable growth across our business verticals backed by investments in our distribution network, brands, manufacturing, digital organizational capabilities. With that, I conclude my address and open the floor for more Q&A. Thank you.  Dabur India Limited November 02, 2023 Abneesh Roy from Nuvama Institutional Equities.

And second, this 560-bps gain in market share for Odomos, on what number is such a sharp gain, what is driving this? And your recent foray in terms of the in-home mosquito essentially LVPs, any initial success if you can share? Mohit Malhotra: Right. So firstly, I think Home Care is a category which is underpenetrated in the country.

So anything to call out why it was weaker? And any specific factors which you think would drive the growth in the second half? Mohit Malhotra: Yes. So I think on Health Supplements very clearly, I think the default came in from Chyawanprash. Because of the season shifting by 20 days, Chyawanprash loading could not happen as it happens in the previous years also. So that has got shifted. So as that gets shifted and the winters have also got shifted, I think it should get covered up. As far as Honey is concerned, the second big brand in our supplement portfolio,",

And just one follow-up question on the legal issue in the U.S. So this 1% of the sales that you have, does that sales get impacted in any way because of the legal challenge or because consumers may be concerned on this product given the case? And secondly, this INR20 crores cost that you said, how many quarters do you think this continues? I'm just trying to understand the period of time in which the legal expenses have to be borne. Mohit Malhotra: Yes. So there is a little bit shadow cast on the business. If you look at the overall Namaste business, which is roughly around $45 million to $50 million business. Out of that, around 25% of the business is relaxer business. Only the relaxer business is impacted by this and that is",

So specifically, there are two parts of question. One, you alluded saying that the winter has started setting in. So is the north winter or north rural has seen these green shoots?

So the trajectory of rural is only getting positive as you are lapping over the lower basis and those lower basis will continue for some time. And I think rural will continue to gain traction, albeit it's happening slowly, but it will happen surely. With MSP increases that the government is announcing, with the election season coming up, some softs will happen. Infrastructure investment is sustaining by the government, direct benefit transfers are in place. So I think on back of all this and rainfall in the crop proceeding has also been good for the winter crop. So on back of all this, I think rural will grow.

I can't comment upon the other companies. But South India, for us, is lagging quite a bit. But I think north -- with winter coming in, north should pick up.

But high double-digit growth is what we are expecting in International Business going forward in the second half also. But I will give a caveat here. With the situation developing in Middle East, which is although Palestine is immaterial for us, we don't have too much of business coming from Palestine, it's a INR3 crores per quarter.

When they take up the defence, they engage the lawyer, kind of an average lawyer or it caps the fee. If somebody wants to defend its position in a better way, they want to engage the best of the layer in the class. So then there will be a certain higher cost than what insurance company reimbursed.

Mohit Malhotra: Thank you, Isha. Good evening, ladies, and gentlemen. We welcome you to Dabur India Limited's conference call pertaining to results for the quarter ended 30th September 2024. This quarter, the sector faced challenges from heavy monsoons, floods, and high food inflation, which slowed down urban consumption, especially in the beverage category for us. However, rural continues to be resilient and has outpaced urban growth for last 3 quarters. We believe urban consumption has bottomed out and should see an improvement going forward. As new channels have been growing ahead of general trade, this has put some pressure on profitability",

One is if you could comment on margins, how it impacts because if you are becoming more sharper in terms of pricing, provided nothing changes, say, in raw material. What happens on margins?

And that has happened because of the premiumisation at one end and also introducing the price points, which are more value offering to consumers on the other end. So both are kind of going hand-in-hand for us. So we've introduced coconut water also, so which are margin accretive to us. We've introduced value-added juices also, which are accretive to us, etc. So that is like kind of balancing our margin. And overall, our margins",

So what is different about your business since you are also very diversified. I understand in juice business there was a clear 2 quarters of issue. But how come it impacts overall business and the quantum if you can discuss that? Second, you mentioned in the coming quarters, the growth will come back to normal. You also said that urban slowdown has bottomed out. Now other companies are not saying that. They are saying this is start and so we need to watch out. So what is your confidence of saying urban has",

Mohit Malhotra: So first, let me answer your second question first. I think as far as urban is concerned, why I say it has bottomed out is because if you look at the base effect, base quarter of urban was very high.  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 It's already gone down to around 2.8% kind of a growth in FMCG urban that we are seeing. I don't think so it's going to go beyond bottoming out from here. And if you really look at the intrinsic urban consumption, which is also driven by e-commerce, quick commerce, modern trade, etc, these channels are definitely showing a high growth, and they now contribute around 24% of the overall salience of our business. That is growing at a very high double digit, and that is 50% of the urban consumption as far as we are concerned. So that is showing no tell-tale signs of diminishing.

But if I look at the Nielsen data, our growth in rural is 600 basis points higher as compared to urban. So rural remains resilient and urban, in my view, should start recovering with the festive season. And we've seen the kharif acreage is also high. So that augurs well for rural, and there has been MSP increases on the Rabi crop also, which should give more disposable income in the hands of the consumer.

Harit Kapoor from Investec Harit Kapoor: I just had two questions. One is on the improving the ROI for the distributor part. So there are other ways as well in terms of credit periods etc, or probably at a numerator level, even taking the margin. Just wanted to know, have any of those other pieces also been moved or it's only been reducing the inventory pipeline? And if it's only inventory days reduction at the distributor level, what's the quantum of that? And is it fair to assume that since you started this on 25th September, it was 6 days reduction?

That is what I think the question was. I hope I've been able to answer. Harit Kapoor: Yes. Just the question was really apart from this 9-day reduction, has there anything else been done, whether it's credit periods or overall percentage margin, etc? Mohit Malhotra: Yes. For the past couple of months, we've been giving a little extra credit to the distributors also. So that has also gone up.

So all that is also happening alongside. Plus this phenomena of ROI reduction is more in urban India rather than rural India.

So as far as urban is concerned, why I'm saying is urban has bottomed out because urban at the same time last year was growing at 11%. Now  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 it's come down to 2.8%. I don't think urban demand will go down. The last urban demand went down was during the COVID time to around minus 2%, 3%. And that was under the COVID time. After that, I think 2.8% is the most bottom kind of demand that I've seen.

And so the rural resilience is going to be picking up. Now coming to food inflation, food inflation is definitely high. If you look at all the subsegments of FMCG growth, we find food is the one which is growing on back of value, on back of price increases, whether it's food, non-staples, or food staples. The rest, Home Care, OTC, and Personal Care by far have remained flat. So I think with urban bottoming out, I see some amount of growth coming in even in the discretionary categories also.

And Northeast was reeling under floods in the quarter 2, and that was a wettest monsoon that we could see in the Northeast, and that was hit. Minus Northeast, our growth was 16%, 17%.

Mohit Malhotra: I think the entire category declined by around 8.6% in terms of volume. We gained a market share of 230 bps. So, if you compare to relative performance vis-a-vis Tropicana or Slice or B- Natural, Real is surely a preferred choice among the consumer in the juices and nectars' market. So market shares have gone up. So it's a very good sign. So in Nielsen data, we've grown higher than the category. That's one. But category itself is declining. So I think Tetra pack is moving to bottles. The consumer preference is they want to see what they are having. So in Tetra pack, we've launched a 1-litre bottle. We have launched a 2-litre bottle. We've launched a 500 mL bottle and there is a 200 mL bottle also at all price points of  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 INR10, INR20, INR100.

And therefore, people are saying that this is not something that is affordable in light of the other options available in the market, and that's why this category is declining. Is that understanding, correct? Mohit Malhotra: Yes, that is a correct understanding. There is a price difference because Campa for 1 litre., which is a party pack and in-home consumption is available at a INR45 –and forget Campa, even Pepsi or Coke is available at around INR50 for a 1-litre price point.

Mohit Malhotra: So therefore, the solution to this is we have pivoted into drinks. Drinks are pegged at a similar price point as soft drinks. That's exactly what I explained to you, INR10, INR20, INR50 and INR100 price point, drink is pegged at par with the carbonated and fruit-based fizz drinks are also at par. That said, it is a small base. So therefore, it cannot compensate for the 80% of the Nectar business. We have to provide value in the Nectar business also. Therefore, we are introducing a INR100 tropical juices in nectars. And also, we are planning to give a value on Nectar by giving a tangible goody there. So that is what we are trying to do.

There are roughly around 20 to 30 warehouses they have. From those 20 warehouses, they supply to 500 to 600 dark stores. From the dark stores, it goes to the consumer. So that's the supply chain which is there, from us to the quick commerce players, all of them, whether it's Zepto or a Blinkit or it is Swiggy. As far as margins are concerned, our margins are around 100 to 200 basis points higher in quick commerce as compared to e-commerce marketplaces.

And what Nielsen does is, which is a syndicated data that the entire industry refers to looking at the consumer demand in urban, they generally track the GT and the pop and mom stores and not so much the quick commerce or the e-commerce players.

But as we lap over the currencies, now it's been happening over a year. And if you look at the first half also, we are down by INR181 crores on the currency depreciation. And this currency depreciation is a translation loss. There is also a transaction loss that happens because a lot of the products in international are imported by us, and they have to pay a dollar currency for the import of that, especially in Turkey market. So therefore, as we lap over the currencies, I think our margins will only improve in Egypt and in Turkey, which are very high salient markets for us. Shirish Pardeshi: Okay",

So historically, we have been a key participator in the Maha Kumbh Melas. What are your plans for this year? And if you can also talk about the benefits as well as the cost that go behind this event? Mohit Malhotra: Yes. So I think for us, we are a rural salient company. 50% of the business comes from rural. And in rural, activations is a very big avenue to touch, feel and experience the product by the consumer. And we are very aggressive in terms of taking hoardings and doing experiential marketing. Last time when Kumbh was there, we did a special RTP campaign in Kumbh and had RTP taps that consumer could come to and take a toothbrush and take RTP on that and use it. And the more they try, the more conviction they build in the product and the more they buy. So this year also, we'll be participating in Maha Kumbh. And we also participated in other melas",

Or is it more lag in terms of demand improvement from all these events?  Dabur India Limited October 30, 2024 Mohit Malhotra: So it's a demand improvement that we get and which results in a better offtake and also sampling. So the more people sample, the more sampling happens, the more cascade effective trials and therefore, repeat purchase and market share moves up. So it's very tangible actually.

Mohit Malhotra: No, my mistake, so yes, health supplement business definitely got impacted because the winters have been little muted, contracted and also delayed, so all the three factors in the winter impacted our Health Supplement portfolio. Basically, Chyawanprash and Honey as we categorize in it. Chyawanprash did get impacted and therefore the growth was very muted. We had a flat growth as well as Chyawanprash is concerned. So, that we put in the store, but one good thing what is happening is that the winter is getting delayed. So,",

The courts have decided on corporate  Dabur India Limited January 31, 2024 separateness, which means that the case is now restricted only to products sold in US by Namaste Legal Entity. So, any of the Dabur affiliate or Dabur products are out of the scope of this case, which means it impacts way less than 1% of our turnover any which way, and it is only restricted to US as of now, and not for products sold anywhere else in the world.

In the power brand, this is more salient and juice saliency is also low in this region. So, it is basically the HPC portfolio which is more salient here.

As I said earlier, you can see some margin expansion. Q4 obviously is a different product profile and hence it is slightly lower than the overall first nine months margins. Having said that, our assessment at this point of time is that the expansion in margins would definitely be higher than what it has been in past nine months. So, if our expansion in margins, including the legal cost is 50 bps as of now. In quarter 4 it will be higher than that.

So, in terms of mix, that premiumization should take care of the inflation which might hit us and we expect the best growth to come in from Oral Care only going forward next year. As far as juice portfolio is concerned, yes, there are headwinds in juices which is basically price driven.

So, there will be a definite leverage on cost which will happen in international business, and we expect profitability to be better. So, in international business one lever is obviously legal cost going down for us which is overlapped. The second will be the dollar denominated currencies are doing better for us. Namaste business is doing better. Middle East and North Africa is doing well. All the pegged currencies are performing well, and we expect them to perform well and depreciating currencies will also overlap the currency depreciation next year. So, as we speak, we have INR 81",

And we've seen in the past also. So, as we go through a number of years, if there is a one year down, next year, the beverage business kind of bounces back for us. So, we are hopeful that if the weather supports us, then beverages as a portfolio should do well for us. And we've also already made an entry into drinks and aloe vera.

So, one is on the industry leaders like the top two players, they are facing ethylene oxide issue in SGHK. So, does that open opportunity for you? And second, if industry leaders are facing this kind of an issue, is there a risk that given raw material sourcing could be fairly common in terms of the channel? Would you also face that kind of a risk? And second is for Badshah, how do you see growth in FY'25? I understand a lot of pricing growth has happened in the second half of the year. How do you see margins? Have you passed on fully? And how do you see overall sales growth in FY'25? Mohit Malhotra: Right. So, first is this burning issue of ethylene oxide.

To me, I can't answer with the great conviction, but in terms of our categories I think it is because in the Hair Oil category in the last quarter has grown by 8%. If you have syndicated data to go by, hair oil as a category has grown by 8% in value. Dabur has grown by around 12% in value and which is very unlike a Hair Oil business going up.

However, when we see your volume growth and the volume growth for other organized players is lower than the industry volume growth indicating that the unorganized guys are clawing back share that they lost in the past few years.

And if these numbers are anything to go by, I think rural recovery should continue because there is such a long hiatus of rural lagging urban. So it should continue and that should be well for the entire industry. I think it's a wave and this wave will continue for some time, and it will take all boats up. So one thing is organized player generally get better dividends when this happens because we have better infrastructure investments in place.

Health supplement business, Chyawanprash, is a relative problem. A, I think the weather did not support us. Chyawanprash generally skews towards winter and winters have been delayed and contracted. And the way wholesale or the trade behaves is typically, you know, in the beginning of the season, pull up a lot of stock and the liquidity of stock as the season progresses. So this time, because of delayed winters, the up-stocking was limited. And whatever up-stocking happened due to contracted winters, that remained on the shelves. And because of delayed winters, the down-stocking happened. So the better thing is that we don't have inventories, too much inventories for next year. But Chyawanprash, we are modifying the format.

Second question, if I look at our annual growth from the lens of power brands and non- power brands, except Oral Care, I believe the other six power brands would not have contributed above our company's average growth rate for this year. So it also means that the last part of heavy lifting for growth was done with the long tail of other brands,",

So juices got impacted, it was flat, so it didn't fire. Mohit Malhotra: Chyawanprash, which is a power brand, did not fire, so that took down the business. And other brands, saliency looks up. But that said, the power brand contribution to the business remains as it is. The growth may not come because of some season issue or other, because it is a power brand at the end of the day that could positively or negatively impact the business.

The moment a brand becomes environmentally conscious, sustainable, consumers are ready to pay a price premium for that. So the moment they pay a price premium, as you become environmentally friendly, it becomes a virtuous loop. Premiumization grows, the brands become quality conscious, environmentally friendly and the premiumization happens and therefore profitability also inches up. So I think consumer rewards you with the profitability and the value that the consumer gets. Now this is relevant for urban India today.

Most of these companies in India are now trading at, are now reporting margins which are in the mid-20s.

What are your thoughts on margin expansion from a long- term perspective in the next three to five years? Mohit Malhotra: Yes, Nillai. That's a very valid question and I think it's good that you keep reiterating this. It actually makes us think more to inch up the margins.

We've seen a slowdown across most of the categories. So can you help us understand, Mohit, the rural and urban side of the current slowdown, which we are seeing? And historically, what we've observed in earlier cycles, we had a diversified portfolio. So that helped us navigate some of the challenges whenever there was a slowdown. So currently, what is hitting us hard? And secondly, you did mention we would want to increase premiumization and try and do some M&A. So directionally, how are we thinking? Is it going to focus more on the Health Care segment, because that is where our leadership would be so good M&A and premiumization in that specific segment? Or is it younger generation, which don't have such habits to some of the products in the Health Care segment. So how are we thinking? And lastly, GT channel inventory",

I think last quarter was a tough quarter in terms of all the three divisions. Now I'll take it one by one. One, beverage business was impacted by competitive intensity and seasons are not favoring us. Plus, what we've done is, if you see the learning coming from last year, we usually load before the season, in anticipation of a good season. So stock gets into the market with the stockist and then the tertiaries and the secondaries happen. This time, we've done less loading. So, around INR50-60crores, of loading has been less in the season. And that's why you see an impact on primary, and",

So therefore, Chyawanprash and Honey, both these two pillars of ours, were actually impacted. Going forward, Honey is getting into a lower base. We had some crystallization problems also, which is also behind us now, and we are seeing good market share gains in Honey going forward. So that is also sorted in my view, and we are embarking on all-season campaign for Chyawanprash. Hopefully, that should address the issues of Health Care.

And do you expect exit rates to be high single-digit revenue growth? Or you said for the full year, it will be high single digits or double-digit type of revenue growth? I didn't quite understand? Mohit Malhotra: I'm talking about average of the full year, but it's a guess at the moment and itall depends upon how the categories are behaving and how the macros are performing. If I go by the macros now, with MSP increases and with the MGNREGA outlay going up by 40% in rural India, rural India already growing around 450 basis points ahead of urban India, food inflation coming down and more money in the hands of the consumer, not taking into account Operation Sindoor.
